/* This file is a compatability layer.  It allows the usage of flexible box 
model layouts accross multiple browsers, including older browsers.  The newest,
universal implementation of the flexible box model is used when available (see
`Modern browsers` comments below).  Browsers that are known to implement this 
new spec completely include:

    Firefox 28.0+
    Chrome 29.0+
    Internet Explorer 11+ 
    Opera 17.0+

Browsers not listed, including Safari, are supported via the styling under the

<p>Now that we have a basic understanding of how SageMaker works we will try to use it to construct a complete project from end to end. Our goal will be to have a simple web page which a user can use to enter a movie review. The web page will then send the review off to our deployed model which will predict the sentiment of the entered review.</p>

You will not need to modify the included code beyond what is requested. Sections that begin with '<strong>TODO</strong>' in the header indicate that you need to complete or implement some portion within them. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a <code># TODO: ...</code> comment. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!</p>
<p>In addition to implementing code, there will be questions for you to answer which relate to the task and your implementation. Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a '<strong>Question:</strong>' header. Carefully read each question and provide your answer below the '<strong>Answer:</strong>' header by editing the Markdown cell.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Note</strong>: Code and Markdown cells can be executed using the <strong>Shift+Enter</strong> keyboard shortcut. In addition, a cell can be edited by typically clicking it (double-click for Markdown cells) or by pressing <strong>Enter</strong> while it is highlighted.</p>

<h2 id="General-Outline">General Outline<a class="anchor-link" href="#General-Outline">&#182;</a></h2><p>Recall the general outline for SageMaker projects using a notebook instance.</p>
<ol>
<li>Download or otherwise retrieve the data.</li>
<li>Process / Prepare the data.</li>
<li>Upload the processed data to S3.</li>
<li>Train a chosen model.</li>
<li>Test the trained model (typically using a batch transform job).</li>
<li>Deploy the trained model.</li>
<li>Use the deployed model.</li>
</ol>
<p>For this project, you will be following the steps in the general outline with some modifications.</p>
<p>First, you will not be testing the model in its own step. You will still be testing the model, however, you will do it by deploying your model and then using the deployed model by sending the test data to it. One of the reasons for doing this is so that you can make sure that your deployed model is working correctly before moving forward.</p>
<p>In addition, you will deploy and use your trained model a second time. In the second iteration you will customize the way that your trained model is deployed by including some of your own code. In addition, your newly deployed model will be used in the sentiment analysis web app.</p>

<pre>The only scary thing about this movie is the thought that whoever made it might make a sequel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From start to finish &#34;The Tooth Fairy&#34; was just downright terrible. It seemed like a badly-acted children&#39;s movie which got confused, with a &#34;Wizard of Oz&#34; witch melting and happy kiddies ending combined with some bad gore effects and swearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Half of the cast seem completely unnecessary except for conveniently being there to get murdered in some fashion. The sister of the two brothers, Cherise the aura reader and Mrs. McDonald have entirely no point in the film - they could have included them in the main plot for some interesting side stories but apparently couldn&#39;t be bothered. The people watching the film know the characters are there for some bloody death scene but come on, at least TRY and have a slight plot for them. The story in general is weak with erratic behavior from the characters that makes you wish they all get eaten by the witch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Add the weak plot and the weak acting together (the children are particularly wooden) and the movie ends up a complete failure. If only MST3K could have had a go at this one ...

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Above we mentioned that <code>review_to_words</code> method removes html formatting and allows us to tokenize the words found in a review, for example, converting <em>entertained</em> and <em>entertaining</em> into <em>entertain</em> so that they are treated as though they are the same word. What else, if anything, does this method do to the input?</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>This method also do other things:</p>
<ul>
<li>All words to lower case</li>
<li>Remove words that has little meaning to understand the review (see the print of stopwords.words("english") 3 cells above);</li>
<li>Split the entire string into an array of strings (each of them a word)</li>
</ul>

<p>The method below applies the <code>review_to_words</code> method to each of the reviews in the training and testing datasets. In addition it caches the results. This is because performing this processing step can take a long time. This way if you are unable to complete the notebook in the current session, you can come back without needing to process the data a second time.</p>

<h2 id="Transform-the-data">Transform the data<a class="anchor-link" href="#Transform-the-data">&#182;</a></h2><p>In the XGBoost notebook we transformed the data from its word representation to a bag-of-words feature representation. For the model we are going to construct in this notebook we will construct a feature representation which is very similar. To start, we will represent each word as an integer. Of course, some of the words that appear in the reviews occur very infrequently and so likely don't contain much information for the purposes of sentiment analysis. The way we will deal with this problem is that we will fix the size of our working vocabulary and we will only include the words that appear most frequently. We will then combine all of the infrequent words into a single category and, in our case, we will label it as <code>1</code>.</p>
<p>Since we will be using a recurrent neural network, it will be convenient if the length of each review is the same. To do this, we will fix a size for our reviews and then pad short reviews with the category 'no word' (which we will label <code>0</code>) and truncate long reviews.</p>

<h3 id="(TODO)-Create-a-word-dictionary">(TODO) Create a word dictionary<a class="anchor-link" href="#(TODO)-Create-a-word-dictionary">&#182;</a></h3><p>To begin with, we need to construct a way to map words that appear in the reviews to integers. Here we fix the size of our vocabulary (including the 'no word' and 'infrequent' categories) to be <code>5000</code> but you may wish to change this to see how it affects the model.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>TODO:</strong> Complete the implementation for the <code>build_dict()</code> method below. Note that even though the vocab_size is set to <code>5000</code>, we only want to construct a mapping for the most frequently appearing <code>4998</code> words. This is because we want to reserve the special labels <code>0</code> for 'no word' and <code>1</code> for 'infrequent word'.</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>The 5 words more frequents given the print of the sorted words above):</p>
<ol>
<li>movi</li>
<li>film</li>

<p>It makes perfect sense that these words are so frequent, cause they are related to the movie reviews universe.</p>

<ul>
<li>Model Artifacts,</li>
<li>Training Code, and</li>
<li>Inference Code,</li>
</ul>
<p>each of which interact with one another. In the XGBoost example we used training and inference code that was provided by Amazon. Here we will still be using containers provided by Amazon with the added benefit of being able to include our own custom code.</p>
<p>We will start by implementing our own neural network in PyTorch along with a training script. For the purposes of this project we have provided the necessary model object in the <code>model.py</code> file, inside of the <code>train</code> folder.

<p>The important takeaway from the implementation provided is that there are three parameters that we may wish to tweak to improve the performance of our model. These are the embedding dimension, the hidden dimension and the size of the vocabulary. We will likely want to make these parameters configurable in the training script so that if we wish to modify them we do not need to modify the script itself. We will see how to do this later on. To start we will write some of the training code in the notebook so that we can more easily diagnose any issues that arise.</p>
<p>First we will load a small portion of the training data set to use as a sample. It would be very time consuming to try and train the model completely in the notebook as we do not have access to a gpu and the compute instance that we are using is not particularly powerful. However, we can work on a small bit of the data to get a feel for how our training script is behaving.</p>

<p>In order to construct a PyTorch model using SageMaker we must provide SageMaker with a training script. We may optionally include a directory which will be copied to the container and from which our training code will be run. When the training container is executed it will check the uploaded directory (if there is one) for a <code>requirements.txt</code> file and install any required Python libraries, after which the training script will be run.</p>

<h3 id="(TODO)-Training-the-model">(TODO) Training the model<a class="anchor-link" href="#(TODO)-Training-the-model">&#182;</a></h3><p>When a PyTorch model is constructed in SageMaker, an entry point must be specified. This is the Python file which will be executed when the model is trained. Inside of the <code>train</code> directory is a file called <code>train.py</code> which has been provided and which contains most of the necessary code to train our model. The only thing that is missing is the implementation of the <code>train()</code> method which you wrote earlier in this notebook.</p>
<p><strong>TODO</strong>: Copy the <code>train()</code> method written above and paste it into the <code>train/train.py</code> file where required.</p>
<p>The way that SageMaker passes hyperparameters to the training script is by way of arguments. These arguments can then be parsed and used in the training script. To see how this is done take a look at the provided <code>train/train.py</code> file.</p>

<h2 id="Step-5:-Testing-the-model">Step 5: Testing the model<a class="anchor-link" href="#Step-5:-Testing-the-model">&#182;</a></h2><p>As mentioned at the top of this notebook, we will be testing this model by first deploying it and then sending the testing data to the deployed endpoint. We will do this so that we can make sure that the deployed model is working correctly.</p>
<h2 id="Step-6:-Deploy-the-model-for-testing">Step 6: Deploy the model for testing<a class="anchor-link" href="#Step-6:-Deploy-the-model-for-testing">&#182;</a></h2><p>Now that we have trained our model, we would like to test it to see how it performs. Currently our model takes input of the form <code>review_length, review[500]</code> where <code>review[500]</code> is a sequence of <code>500</code> integers which describe the words present in the review, encoded using <code>word_dict</code>. Fortunately for us, SageMaker provides built-in inference code for models with simple inputs such as this.</p>
<p>There is one thing that we need to provide, however, and that is a function which loads the saved model. This function must be called <code>model_fn()</code> and takes as its only parameter a path to the directory where the model artifacts are stored. This function must also be present in the python file which we specified as the entry point. In our case the model loading function has been provided and so no changes need to be made.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: When the built-in inference code is run it must import the <code>model_fn()</code> method from the <code>train.py</code> file. This is why the training code is wrapped in a main guard ( ie, <code>if __name__ == '__main__':</code> )</p>
<p>Since we don't need to change anything in the code that was uploaded during training, we can simply deploy the current model as-is.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> When deploying a model you are asking SageMaker to launch an compute instance that will wait for data to be sent to it. As a result, this compute instance will continue to run until <em>you</em> shut it down. This is important to know since the cost of a deployed endpoint depends on how long it has been running for.</p>
<p>In other words <strong>If you are no longer using a deployed endpoint, shut it down!</strong></p>
<p><strong>TODO:</strong> Deploy the trained model.</p>

<li>Removed any html tags and stemmed the input</li>

<p>As we saw above, by default the estimator which we created, when deployed, will use the entry script and directory which we provided when creating the model. However, since we now wish to accept a string as input and our model expects a processed review, we need to write some custom inference code.</p>
<p>We will store the code that we write in the <code>serve</code> directory. Provided in this directory is the <code>model.py</code> file that we used to construct our model, a <code>utils.py</code> file which contains the <code>review_to_words</code> and <code>convert_and_pad</code> pre-processing functions which we used during the initial data processing, and <code>predict.py</code>, the file which will contain our custom inference code. Note also that <code>requirements.txt</code> is present which will tell SageMaker what Python libraries are required by our custom inference code.</p>
<p>When deploying a PyTorch model in SageMaker, you are expected to provide four functions which the SageMaker inference container will use.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>model_fn</code>: This function is the same function that we used in the training script and it tells SageMaker how to load our model.</li>
<li><code>input_fn</code>: This function receives the raw serialized input that has been sent to the model's endpoint and its job is to de-serialize and make the input available for the inference code.</li>
<li><code>output_fn</code>: This function takes the output of the inference code and its job is to serialize this output and return it to the caller of the model's endpoint.</li>
<li><code>predict_fn</code>: The heart of the inference script, this is where the actual prediction is done and is the function which you will need to complete.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the simple website that we are constructing during this project, the <code>input_fn</code> and <code>output_fn</code> methods are relatively straightforward. We only require being able to accept a string as input and we expect to return a single value as output. You might imagine though that in a more complex application the input or output may be image data or some other binary data which would require some effort to serialize.</p>
<h3 id="(TODO)-Writing-inference-code">(TODO) Writing inference code<a class="anchor-link" href="#(TODO)-Writing-inference-code">&#182;</a></h3><p>Before writing our custom inference code, we will begin by taking a look at the code which has been provided.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The default behaviour for a deployed PyTorch model is to assume that any input passed to the predictor is a <code>numpy</code> array. In our case we want to send a string so we need to construct a simple wrapper around the <code>RealTimePredictor</code> class to accomodate simple strings. In a more complicated situation you may want to provide a serialization object, for example if you wanted to sent image data.</p>

b&#39;I caught this a few times on TV in the late 1970s. It only played late at night (past midnight).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peter Lorre plays a kind, happy man whose face is disfigured in a fire. He is rejected by his girlfriend and left alone and filled with despair. He turns to a life of crime and eventually becomes very successful. He makes a mask to hide his disfigured features and falls in love with a beautiful girl (Evelyn Keyes)...who is blind! He tries to go straight for her...but he can\&#39;t escape his life of crime or his hatred of his own scarred face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A no budget B film. Very short (runs only a little over an hour) but well made and superbly acted by Lorre. This has a lot more depth than you would expect from a quickie B picture. Ankers especially takes the thankless &#34;girl&#34; role and makes her character fresh and appealing. This has sadly disappeared from TV and was never put on video or DVD (as far as I know). TCM did show it recently and it was great to see the movie still holds up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.&#39;
b&#39;This movie is all about blaxploitation, there is absolutely no plot at all. A pimp stops some bad guys with his kung fu hoes to try to get his nightclub back. Rated R for Strong Language, and a brief sexual situation.&#39;
b&#39;Flash Gordon was a first rate serial. I know there were a few goofs, however, i didn\&#39;t watch it for the flaws. Buster Crabbe is Flash Gordon. He was not a trained actor but he gave a very good, convincing performance. Jean Rogers is pretty and at 20 yrs. old did, in my opinion, a pretty good job. Charles Middleton as Emperor Ming, is superb. He was in a lot of other movies, quite versatile, he could sing and dance. His portrayal of &#34;Ming The Merciless&#34;, in all 3 Flash Gordon serials, was top notch. The rest of the cast also did a very good job. Well, boys and girls, get some popcorn, settle back and enjoy. John R. Tracy.&#39;
b&#39;I\&#39;ve been a fan of Larry King\&#39;s show for awhile, I think he does a terrific job overall and I don\&#39;t think he ever \&#39;wusses\&#39; out, as so many people seem to believe. He\&#39;s a subtle Scorpio, he gets his zings in when he needs to, just as he managed to do last night with Paris Hilton, during her first post-jail TV interview.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing about this entire case that has really amazed me is that Hilton is still apparently clueless about why Judge Sauer gave her what she believes was a too-harsh sentence (and what\&#39;s more, actually MADE her serve it) . In all the time she was in jail, supposedly alone 23 hours a day in her cell, she never once, in her mind, rewound the events which led to her being given the sentence that Judge Sauer saw fit to impose on her. She never once realized that it just might have set off a major red flag when she (1) showed up late in court for the original hearing and (2) proceeded to inform him, when he asked her did she not know that her license had been suspended, did she not get the papers in the mail, that &#34;I have people who read that sort of thing for me.&#34; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the time she was in her cell, she never came to the realization that this action (showing up late) and that statement -- and more importantly, the attitude - the utter cavalier disregard for the court system and the law in general and her driving privileges in particular that she displayed -- just might have made Judge Sauer (pardon the pun) go sour on her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last night, on King\&#39;s show, after giving lip service to how she has been changed forever by her traumatic experience, how she has &#34;learned&#34; her lesson, she answered his question, &#34;Do you think you got a raw deal?&#34; with a resounding yes. And during the course of the conversation (if you can call it that), she said more than once that she did not feel she deserved what had happened to her. King asked, gently, more than once, if she does not feel she creates the situations in her life that she &#34;finds&#34; herself in, to which she pretty much stared at him blankly. She basically, therefore, holds the conscious belief that she\&#39;s been victimized in this situation; she does not understand how she herself caused it, that day in court, by her cavalier attitude with the judge. I feel this is very sad - tragic, even, considering what a huge &#34;role model&#34; Hilton is to some people, and it renders anything she said last night about her so-called rehabilitated state into the realms of complete and utter cluelessness, contradiction and hypocrisy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the course of the interview, Hilton alluded to spending a lot of time in her cell reading the Bible. At the end of the interview, King scored major points by asking her what her favorite Bible passage was. She responded by groping perplexedly at her pathetic notes (completely superficial non-insights, which she had read on air as if she were Nelson Mandella or something) and finally grunting out, &#34;I don\&#39;t have a favorite passage.&#34; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Judge Sauer, in my book, is a hero, and after last night, so is Larry King, for subtly exposing Hilton for what she truly is.&#39;
b&#34;Here is a much lesser known 50&#39;s sci-fi with a little different twist. An atomic researchers son is kidnapped and held for a ransom of the the Father&#39;s atomic secrets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a tightly knit atomic sci-fi thriller with great production values and above average acting, even from the kid. The Atomic City actually has a movie feel to it unlike a lot of other 50&#39;s sci-fi of this time which which came off more like an episode of a TV show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Atomic City was also actually nominated for an Academy Award for Best Screenplay - how many other 50&#39;s sci-fi can tout an Academy Award Nomination?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great pacing, tight direction and some superb location filming in the &#39;real&#39; Atomic City of Los Alamos, New Mexico make this one worth hunting down. The collectors print in circulation is an above average transfer and makes for a great double feature with the Atomic Man!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.&#34;
b&#39;I thought this movie was awesome and the two guys nick and aaron are hotties!!!!! I wish i could watch it over and over. I loved the plot and whole concept of the movie. It is great and I wish i had taped it last night.Nick I love You!!!!!!&#39;
b&#39;The relationship between the main characters I thought was very realistic. How the two end up involved is believable. It doesn\&#39;t have that whole &#34;oh yeah right&#34; that most Hollywood movies have. Not too mention how they captured the sexy, beautiful and painful side of trapeze. I am a trapeze student and I love that they showed how hard it is on the body, hands and yeah those fabric burns are brutal! Definitely a must see for the relationship as well as the art that is made in the movie. I loved it! I\&#39;m happy with the way the movie ended but I definitely wanted to see more. Be sure to stay seated through the credits for a special treat hehe. Great scene!&#39;
b&#39;Young Elijah Wood and Joseph Mazzello are outstanding in this excellent film about two boys who have promised to &#34;take care of their mother,&#34; and how they cope when their new stepfather begins beating the younger boy. The supporting cast around the boys is top-notch as well. The script really gets inside the mind and heart of an imaginative child. It\&#39;s hard to believe Wood could grow up to look anything like Tom Hanks, but that\&#39;s nothing new in Hollywood. That\&#39;s honestly my only criticism of the film.&#39;
b&#34;This review is based on the Producer&#39;s Cut: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;Halloween 5&#39; was a major disappointment at the box office way back in &#39;89. Personally, I&#39;ve always loved it and am proud to have it in my collection. But because of it&#39;s failure and also because of rights issues, it would be 6 years before we would see another installment. The film had the makings of being one of the best, if not the best in the series. A hardcore fan writing the script, the return of not only Donald Pleasence as Dr. Loomis and George Wilbur as Michael Myers, but also the return of the character of Tommy Doyle from the first film, a major studio backing the project, and a Fall release all made the film sound like a hit in the making. So what went wrong? I&#39;ll give you two good reasons: Re-shoots and poor editing. Due to a bad test screening and also the unfortunate passing of Donald Pleasence, the film was changed, and not for the better. The film, like parts III and 5, tanked at the box office and earned negative reviews from both critics and most series fans. But then, thanks to the magic of bootlegging, the original cut leaked out and many fans, including my self, were very happy. I will end this portion of my review by saying this: This film is, so far at least, my favorite &#39;Halloween&#39; film and I&#39;m not afraid to admit that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: The score is simply spellbinding. Has some of the best writing and dialogue of the series. &#39;Halloween 4&#39; emulated the original in that it was more about suspense and mood instead of blood and guts, and 6 is the same way. Great performances, especially from the late and very missed Donald Pleasence. Moves at a breathtaking pace. An interesting explanation for Michael&#39;s evil and why he won&#39;t die. Some brutal kills. Some pretty chilling moments, my favorite being the one involving Kim Darby&#39;s character. A lot of really cool nods to the previous films. Some good surprises. Like the previous two sequels, this one has an awesome cliffhanger ending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Though the explanation for Michael&#39;s evil is fascinating, it does make him a little less scary. Since when can Michael move around from place to place so fast? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final thoughts: This was the first &#39;Halloween&#39; that I saw in the theatre. I was so excited because I really had thought 5 would be the last and then I heard this was happening. I enjoyed it at the time, but over time I saw it for what it really was: A great movie trapped in an OK one with a terrible ending. Why did the filmmakers have to listen to the people at the test screenings? If they had released this superior version it may have done much better and the series might not be stuck in the mess it&#39;s in right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My rating: 5/5&#34;
b&#39;If you have not heard of this film, it follows two Sudanese refugees from a refugee camp in Africa to America, where they convince themselves they will find success and riches. Life is harder than expected in the states, and this film beautifully captures the frustration felt when things are not going right. The lives are captured so well many moments seem scripted because they\&#39;re so perfect. Whether it be on the job, at school, or the time in between, the two boys, Peter and Santino, are very honest with the filmmakers, and make some very thought-provoking comments about life in the states. It\&#39;s one of the only documentaries I can recall that, when it ended, I wanted it to go on for another two hours. It might be difficult to find this movie cause it didn\&#39;t get great distribution, but check your local &#34;art house&#34; or independent theater and give this one a go (side note, if you\&#39;re reading this when it\&#39;s already on video then definitely it\&#39;s worth a rent). Rating: 28/40&#39;
b&#34;This is a totally awesome movie! If you haven&#39;t seen it yet, you damn well should. Sure, the plot is slow to develop, the special effects are laughable, the acting is ridiculous and the action is badly choreographed, but as wrestler DDP would say; That&#39;s not a bad thing....that&#39;s a good thing! Everything about this movie is hilarious, especially if you get the dubbed version, which has even worse actors. It&#39;s countless laughs until you get to the end, yearning for the sequel, where the mummy fights wrestling women. Thus, I give it ten stars. Unless you&#39;re one of those &#39;discriminating&#39; and &#39;intelligent&#39; people with good taste, who likes only &#39;high quality&#39; films of the highest calibre, I recommend this utterly monkeydellic movie!&#34;
b&#34;its been years since i have seen these shows. i have been searching years for anyone else that has seen these or know anything about them. i thought i made them up. the one i remember most is the soldier and death. i&#39;d ask movie fanatics if they had seen these, mentioning its a Jim Henson and people still didn&#39;t know. these are great fables. i was very young when i was these, not even 10 and it left a lasting impression on my life and beliefs. i would recommend anyone to watch these, just remember they are from the 80&#39;s so they don&#39;t look like the movies today. just give them a shot. Jim Henson was way ahead of his time and died to early.&#34;
b&#34;The only print of CHIKAMATUS MONOGATARI I&#39;ve been able to find was abysmal - I almost couldn&#39;t watch it. Which is a shame as this is among the greatest Mizoguchi films. The story - which I believe had been done before and since by other Japanese directors - is a bit straighter than my favorite Mizoguchi films (SANSHO THE BAILIFF and UGETSU MONOGATARI), and is essentially a tale of tragic romance, in this case a transgressive romance that crosses strict class boundaries. As always with Mizoguchi, there is an exquisitely expressed tone of defiance, and - bad print aside - I was very pleased. As with all of Mizoguchi&#39;s films, I&#39;m eagerly awaiting a restored DVD release - whenever that may come...&#34;
b&#39;I saw this movie on my flight from Philly to Denver. The screen was three rows in front of me and about 12&#34; x 10&#34;. So I really wasn\&#39;t going to watch it. But I like Malcolm in the Middle, so I thought I\&#39;d watch just a few minutes. Next thing I know I\&#39;m sucked in, having a great time, and was pleased as how good it was and how fast it seemed to make the time go by. I agree with that the acting is very good for this level of entertainment. Being one of the older baby boomers, I was also pleased to see Lee Majors with a role in the movie, as with a couple of other actors who were famous (Jamiel?) &#34;yesterday&#34; but are out of the spotlight today poking fun at themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s your basic &#34;kid is wronged, kid gets even (and then some), and everyone enjoys themselves in the process&#34;. No heavy thinking, no great analysis needed. Just a good fun way to pass the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.5 out of 5.&#39;
b&#39;This film is a tapestry, a series of portraits of Rom communities woven together by music. It\&#39;s very much a musician\&#39;s film, because of the paucity of spoken dialogue - and what dialogue there is, is not important to the structure of the narrative. Some might expect a National Geographic tale of &#34;customs, dress, and music&#34; or a plot-line orbiting a few central characters - don\&#39;t look for that here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is because it paints a portrait of a family of peoples, rather than telling a story of individuals. The plot is the story through space (India to Andalucia) and/or/ time (we cannot tell) of a people. There is no need of narration. You get a sense of a joyous people, strongly linked in small communities where social interaction is very important. And a great sense of sadness in parts, at their rejection by society at large.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it\&#39;s a paean to Rom culture, very beautifully shot, with a wide spectrum of Rom music, and a sting in the tail which is the oppression these people have faced, and still face.&#39;
b&#39;I found this move beautiful, enjoyable, and uplifting. Initially the local sites in the film, which was filmed here in Buffalo, intrigued me. Later I found myself lost in the power of the film. How do you repay a gift from God? The ability of characters to rise above their base natures and respond to the touch from God warmed my heart. The entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film. I left the theater with a lilt in my step, joy in my heart and hope for the human race. What more can any film do? Hollywood, I hope your paying attention. America does like positive, upbeat films.&#39;
b&#39;It is not always certain that by mixing comedians together you will produce laughter. The comics involved have to actually like or admire each other, or be willing to put up with each other\&#39;s crankiness. GO WEST with the Marx Brothers had Buster Keaton write the script as a gag man. Groucho did not think too highly of Keaton\&#39;s ideas, and embarrassed him at a script meeting. And though some of Keaton\&#39;s gems still appear in the finished film (such as the gun that turns into a brush that turns into a gun) the film was one of the weakest the Marx Brothers ever made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A better film, but also affected by dueling comic egos, was W.C. Fields and Mae West in MY LITTLE CHICKADEE, which jettisoned the script for a series of duels of one liners between the leads. But the one liners were equally funny, so the film remains a success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But SIX OF A KIND is an example of six film comics who worked well together. The reason is simple: it is really three comic teams working together: Charlie Ruggles and Mary Boland, George Burns and Gracie Allan, and W.C. Fields and Alison Skipworth. Ruggles and Boland were paired in about half a dozen comedies during the 1930s, usually with Boland as a somewhat bossy wife, and Ruggles as a nervous wreck of a husband. Fields (usually a single act) was paired three times with Skipworth (TILLY AND GUS and IF I HAD A MILLION were the other two times). Skippy always figured out how to control or counter the larcenous activities of her man - it the present film she takes action into her own hands with the stolen money that is being searched for (she knows that the local sheriff, Fields, is not the one to trust with this). As for Burns and Allan they manage to effortlessly involve themselves with the put upon Ruggles and Boland on their cross-country trip by car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ruggles quickly gets to realize what a mistake it was to agree to travel with Gracie - at one point she manages to cause him to fall off a cliff, and dangle from a branch. He is relatively helpless when she insists on 1) photographing him on his perch, and 2) correcting his grammar. The presence of George and Gracie\&#39;s humongous dog (&#34;Ran Tang Tang&#34; is it\&#39;s name) does not make travel arrangements easier for Charlie and Mary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fields has some choice moments. When he insists on shouting at the quartet, he says he\&#39;s allowed to do so - he\&#39;s the sheriff! He also explains, during a pool game, the improbable story of how he got his undeserved moniker &#34;Honest John&#34;. You have to listen carefully to the tale, as it is interrupted with his attempts to play pool a few times (once getting accidentally beaned by a billiard ball), but it does show that there were items that even Fields would have had no reason to steal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, in the &#34;Summary Line&#34;, I mentioned a forgotten actor named Bradley Page - he was the man who is responsible for the trouble that Charley Ruggles is suspected of. Bradley has to have a reason to leave town in order to catch up with the unwary Ruggles and Boland, so he telephones his girl friend. He tells her to call back his job and say that he has to leave town because somebody has died. There is a pause as he apparently hears a question shot back by the girlfriend. &#34;ANYBODY!&#34;, he says - clearly annoyed. Although the bulk of the humor in the film is carried by the sextet of performers, Mr.Page happened to have the most amusingly unexpected line in the film.&#39;
b&#39;If you\&#39;re looking for a kung-fu action movie, look elsewhere. While there are fighting scenes, the film revolves around its provincial protagonist, who struggles to find her way in Americanized Canton. Unlike most &#34;kung-fu comedies,&#34; the action scenes are used to reinforce the comedy, instead of the other way around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheung Booi is a statement about the farcical nature of kung-fu movies, where the stars always seem to find some reason to fight. Instead of some grand drama about honor and respect, minor misunderstandings cause the characters to yell at each other and start beating each other up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Young Auntie, as it\&#39;s known in the West, is the story of Cheng Tai-nun, played by Kara Hui, who is a young woman who marries an elderly landowner to keep his holdings from falling into the hands of his greedy and corrupt brother. After he dies, she moves to Canton to live with her nephew, played by director Lau Kar Leung, and his son Ah Tao, played by Hsiao Ho.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The basis of the irony is that although Cheng is the same age as Ah Tao, her manner is more akin to her status as his step-great-aunt. While Ah Tao speaks English (extremely poorly), plays the guitar and goes to costume parties, Cheng utterly fails when she tries to adapt to her lifestyle in Canton, complete with makeup, revealing gowns, high heels and dance scenes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What makes this movie great is its realization. Lau Kar Leung is perhaps one of the greatest, if not the greatest director of his generation in Hong Kong, and Kara Hui won &#34;Best Actress&#34; at the first Hong Kong Film Awards in 1982. Also, this is arguably Hsiao Ho\&#39;s finest performance. His chemistry with Hui is remarkable, and although he went on to have a storied career in kung-fu comedies, often working alongside Sammo Hung, he has the perfect combination of athleticism and comedy. As the romantic tension and intrigue build in the second half of the movie, his entire countenance changes. No longer does he easily jaunt through life without a care in the world. He becomes the straight man and his cohorts the Kramer, Elaine and George.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one complaint is how suddenly the comedic aspects of the film die off during the conclusion. The film transitions from outright farce to dramatic intrigue with little but a change in incidental music. But there is a certain symmetry in it. The film begins focused on the intrigue, focused more on Lau Kar Leung\&#39;s character, and it ends that way, too. But the final scene returns to the movie\&#39;s comedic roots, giving conclusion to both aspects of the film.&#39;
b&#39;10/10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLOT DISCUSSION&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the best movies ever made and I am not saying that because I am being fooled by the seemingly nonsensical presentation. Those who dislike the film because they don\&#39;t understand the story often criticize those who are praising the film by saying that they are assuming its genius because they don\&#39;t understand it. I don\&#39;t view this movie as very allegorical. To me, it is a story with a beginning, middle and end. People become confused by the film because they expect it to have a deep, philosophical meaning that they are to interpret from the allegedly meaningless scenes. I feel they fail to realize that the crypticness comes from a chopped-up and rearranged plot combined with a very long and rather explanatory fantasy sequence and not from a chaos of visual allegory. Because of the limitation of length, I will try to keep this short and to the point and touch on the major concepts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The general plot: Diane moves to L.A. after jitterbug contest to get into acting. At an audition, she meets Camilla with whom she falls in love. Diane becomes enraged with jealousy since Camilla sleeps with other men and women. Diane discovers the other man (the director) at a film shoot and discovers the other woman (a random blond) at the engagement party for Camilla and the director. Motivated by her rage and possessiveness, Diane hires a hit man to kill Camilla. After that is done, she is overcome by loneliness and slips into an unconscious fantasy world where she lives the life she wants to. Diane is then awakened. In her conscious state she is haunted by what she has done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The significance of the fantasy: The film starts out, after the credits, with a 1st person p.o.v. shot depicting somebody collapsing onto a bed and slipping into unconsciousness. This is where Diane\&#39;s fantasy starts. The accident is there as an excuse for her to &#34;bring back&#34; her dead girlfriend and justify the fantasy life. She depicts her girlfriend as meek and innocent because that is what she wished she was. In the meantime, she acts like everything is &#34;like in the movies&#34; because she has an escapist personality. She also, in a sense, kills herself off and assumes the identity of a waitress named Betty at a diner. The story revolving around the director is a direct result of her feeling that he was in someway victimized in reality just as she was and &#34;convinces&#34; herself that he was forced to choose Camilla. It was also an unconscious expression of the lack of control she felt during the party. Camilla Rhoades in the fantasy is actually the random blond from the engagement party. She hated her so much that she turned her into Camilla and made the ultimate antagonist. She then took the real Camilla and turned her into a perfect, submissive out-of-the-movies girlfriend and used Rita Hayworth as an inspiration. She also paints the hit man as a very clumsy and incapable person to further justify the survival of Camilla. Her fantasy world, unfortunately for her, was a search for Diane which ended up being herself and made the dreamworld die by taking her through a series of reminders of reality. The first reminder was Club Silencio which chanted that &#34;there is no band&#34; and the &#34;instruments&#34; you hear are not really there; this is a metaphor for the fantasy. She begins to shake violently because it shakes her perception of her surroundings. The other reminder is the blue box... Actually, the blue box is not the reminder itself (more of a Pandora\&#39;s Box, really), but the blue key that opens the box. The blue key reminds her of the actual death of Camilla because it is what the hit man said would show up when it was done. Along with having love, this entire creation of hers is an escape from reality by living in the idealized Hollywood that she expected to be part of when she arrived. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a story showing the psychology of a very troubled woman who lost a dream. It is not series of random things specifically designed to disturb and it is not a cryptic philosophical message. It is an unfortunate chunk of the human condition that is presented beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, ultimately this is all my opinion. I may be way off. Or it may not be intended to mean any one thing. There are many who disagree with me. Great! Afterall, why does it have to mean anything? Why can\&#39;t it just be a statement in itself? What if coherent, sensible narratives are shackles for artistic expression? Peter Greenaway, for example, has spent many words eloquently supporting that idea by such statements as &#34;I would argue that if you want to write narratives, be an author, be a novelist, don\&#39;t be a film maker. Because I believe film making is so much more exciting in areas which aren\&#39;t primarily to do with narrative.&#34; And where is the written rule that everything must be immediately understandable with only one possible interpretation? There is no such rule because the clarity of the movie is unrelated to the art of it. &#34;I didn\&#39;t understand it!&#34; So...? &#34;Mulholland Dr.,&#34; story or not, affects the viewers, harasses them, drags them, awes them, lulls them. The way it lends itself to interpretation is amazing. It never gets old. It never loses its luster. Its visuals are always effective and beautiful. It is cinematic perfection no matter what. Enjoy.&#39;
b&#39;Of course, going into it, one would expect it to be a typical, stupid T&amp;A flick, and it is. But it really does have some fairly well thought out humorous moments. Given the era in which it was made, and the obvious exploitation aspect, it is still one of the better B comedies of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While watching this movie, you will see quite obviously the inspiration for many of the scenes in &#34;Revenge of The Nerds&#34;, and numerous other films of the same genre. Most of the acting is horrible, and WAY over the top, but that\&#39;s exactly what I expect in a movie like this. What it lacks in the way of acting ability, it more than makes up for with its camp value and complete disregard for anything of merit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The amazing thing about this movie, is that there was obviously some money that went into it. Films like this made today just don\&#39;t have the same style. If you can turn your brain off, and turn your sense of humor up for an hour and a half, you will enjoy this flick. I dare anyone to not find at least SOMETHING in this movie that they think is funny, if not hilarious.&#39;
b&#39;Okay. Here\&#39;s the thing. I\&#39;ve read through the comments of other viewers --- some trashing the film and some saying it\&#39;s the funniest, darkest, blackest comedy ever made. Whiffs of Tarantino, etc. Well, not exactly. But, guess what? It\&#39;s still an enjoyable and, ultimately, funny film. Not brilliant, not trash. Liv Tyler gives a great performance and you absolutely cannot take your eyes off her. She\&#39;s a woman with very strong decorating ideas...Matt Dillon, a greatly underrated and under-used actor, is wonderful, as ever. He always manages to stride that delicate line between scruff and soul, and he pulls off the comedy beautifully. Ditto John Goodman (though the religious overtones, probably funny in the script, really don\&#39;t work). Paul Reiser is very good --- definitely better than he was on TV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The usually unbearable Michael Douglas is actually great in this role. As for his coif, well, see the film. Between this and &#34;Wonder Boys,&#34; you\&#39;re actually reminded of the fact that Douglas can act. The movie will make you laugh in parts. Okay, not exactly belly-laughing, but definitely in the I\&#39;m-amused-I\&#39;m-very-amused category. If you\&#39;re renting this expecting to see another &#34;Pulp Fiction,&#34; forget it. But if want something kinda hip and kinda fun, this is a damned good choice.&#39;
b&#39;Not having seen the 1936 version of this story, I cannot offer any comparison there. I can, however, state that Stephen Sondheim\&#39;s musical treatment of this story is absolutely genius. Only Sondheim could come up with music and lyrics that are stellar in their own right, yet perfectly suited to the very bizarre subject matter. If anyone needs an explanation of what a dark comedy is, they should see this (and &#34;Dr. Strangelove&#34; as well). When Mrs. Lovett goes from having the &#34;worst pies in London&#34; to a booming business with high acclaim, we aren\&#39;t talking &#34;Soylent Green,&#34; - but the ingredients are similar. Particularly brilliant is the song where Mrs. Lovett pitches her idea to Mr. Todd. Even in the introductory number, the line &#34;...they went to their Maker impeccably shaved...&#34; gives a great indication of the premise, the drama, AND the comedy to come. Outstanding!&#39;
b&#39;I had the great pleasure of recently viewing this beautifully filmed wide-screen adaption of the the 1943 stage revival (which unlike the original 1935 production) which included extensive spoken recitatives. This had been the fashion at the time, so to blame the film for an 16 year tradition. The film should be seen if only for Sammy Davis Jrs brilliant catlike performance as Sportin\&#39; Life, creeping in and out of shadows. His seduction of Dorothy Dadridge\&#39;s BESS &#34;There\&#39;s a Boat dat\&#39;s leavin\&#39; soon for New York,&#34; is one of many highlights. Nearly all of the principal music is intact and beautifully sung. It certainly never bores which the recent PBS and MET versions did. It was a pleasure to see that time had not diminished the movie, and hopefully it will be made available in the near future for the generations that haven\&#39;t had a chance to experience it.&#39;
b&#39;I tuned in to this movie because there was nothing else to watch. I was immediately sucked in by the characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robin Tunney is nothing less than spectacular in this film. Her portrayal of a mentally ill woman is both moving and 100% believable. Really, this sort of thing is not easy to do. She pulls it off fantastically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We know early on this film is going to end tragically, but you cannot take your eyes off of it. The characters do stupid things, but unlike most Hollywood movies where people do stupid things because the plot demands it, these people do stupid things because the are not right in the head - and the things they do are completely consistent with their characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is just a great example of film making IMHO. Great writing, great acting, great directing. A film for people who think film can be more than mindless entertainment.&#39;
b&#34;This movie is such a fine example of the greatness that is 80&#39;s entertainment. Oh don&#39;t get me wrong, most of the music back then sucked. I only ever liked the metal bands from the 80s. Bands that had some balls. Forget that whiny keyboard crap and all that &#39;life is horrible and I want to die&#39; garbage. But the movies from the 80&#39;s are the best. They were all about nonsense and just having a good time. This movie exemplifies that! Party! Get naked! Get laid! WOOOOOOHOOOOO!&#34;
b&#34;I had been interested in this film for a long time, especially after reading a couple of online reviews of the DVD edition; however, I kept postponing its purchase because of the excessive price-tag and utter lack of relevant supplements. When it went out-of-print earlier this year, I finally gave in - but the entire order (which included a number of other highly-desirable titles) got lost in transit!; luckily, the DVD has been re-issued at bargain-price - and I&#39;m sure glad I picked it up! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this is one strange film, and a genuine sleeper: initially confusing but striking occult tale which manages to hit bullseye with respect to both its forbidding small-town atmosphere and the inherent eeriness of the sinister goings-on. A small cast responds perfectly to a terse, absorbing and intelligent script: lead Strother Martin, in particular, makes the dialogue sound better than it actually is with his nuanced performance as the town doctor/head of the witch&#39;s coven; L.Q. Jones and Alvy Moore (both of whom also produced the film!) offer solid support as the no-nonsense sheriff and his comic-strip aficionado assistant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot merges elements of various earlier films dealing with witchcraft and the supernatural, and not only the obvious titles: the fact that the town is held under a spell which can&#39;t at first be identified, for instance, brings instantly to mind the similar affliction of one specific bourgeois household in Luis Bunuel&#39;s sublimely surreal THE EXTERMINATING ANGEL (1962)!; the &#39;possessed children&#39; angle was borrowed, perhaps, from VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED (1960); there have been many films - especially of a recent vintage - where the satanic rites of a witches&#39; coven are shown: from THE CITY OF THE DEAD (1960) to THE DEVIL RIDES OUT (1968) but, since the proceedings take place in modern-day America (albeit in remote surroundings) and revolve around elderly witches (seeking a &#39;renaissance&#39;), the film they recall most of all is ROSEMARY&#39;S BABY (1968).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The occult scenes (accentuated as much by foggy exteriors as by the shadowy lighting of the garishly-decorated house where the diabolical events take place) are presented in a completely matter-of-fact way as to make them unsettling and extremely effective - particularly the opening sequence involving an army tank crushing a car(!), the rampage of a devil-doll (a concept which has been done to death over the years but, here, it raises an undeniable frisson), a surreal dream sequence (set inside the ice chamber where all the victims are kept, since they can&#39;t be buried!), a sequence where the witches attack a doubting member of the coven, a beheading committed by a horse-riding medieval knight(!) and the lengthy &#39;black mass&#39; finale (with the witches, accompanied by the respective child they will be &#39;taking over&#39;, all dressed in red - except for a black-clad Martin presiding over the ceremony) which culminates in ritual mass suicide! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film also has the guts to deliver a downbeat &#39;curtain&#39;; it&#39;s so refreshing to come across a title (albeit a low-budget production) from a major Hollywood studio, Columbia, that contrives to go so completely against the grain (like, I said, the film is quite weird - extending also to the editing and the score)! It&#39;s odd, too, that such a classy - and cinematic - horror offering {sic} should come from a TV director most often associated with Westerns and other family fare! By the way, the same theme was dealt with almost contemporaneously in the nth Christopher Lee/Peter Cushing collaboration NOTHING BUT THE NIGHT (1972; which Lee produced himself!) - a film I foolishly missed out on some 20 years back when it was shown on local TV, and which has been M.I.A. ever since!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. This review of THE BROTHERHOOD OF Satan will certainly contain spoilers but, then, the synopsis and artwork featured on the DVD cover manage to give everything away anyway!&#34;
b&#39;A beautifully photographed and paced short film. It evocatively captures the feeling of this family and much of the country during the period just prior to and after Pearl Harbor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciated the visual look of the film -- naturalistic and simultaneously poetic. Great work by a great D.P., David Boyd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though a family film, the story never becomes maudlin or saccharin. We understand and believe the motivation that propels the young boy on his odyssey. I understand the love of the younger brother for his older brother and do not question why he sets out to do what he does. I understand that he is driven by a deep desire to be with his brother in this time of crisis. The kid is tough, and the performance by Jonathan Furr is superb as is the veteran performance by Ron Perlman.&#39;
b&#39;I\&#39;m not usually into dark/psychological thriller type things. However, SEIZING ME is really an amazing piece of work. The story, acting, filming, psychological themes, erotic quality and spiritual understanding are all really quite complex and compelling. Rose plays the complexities and shifts of a psychologically disturbed woman really quite accurately. My partner was particularly impressed with the sophisticated way the power exchange issues were handled. It was so intense for us to watch that we found ourselves leaving it three quarters through to &#34;get tea&#34; and I felt compelled to have a shower. The story was gripping but we were clearly unable to handle all the energy in one straight shot. (It delves into the gritty and grimy side of people, but doesn\&#39;t leave you there). I thought about the characters and deeper meanings for a long time. I would highly recommend this one. Still be prepared for an experience you might not be expecting.&#39;
b&#34;The movie is not halve as bad as people want to make you believe it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is the reason why so many people hate this movie? Is it because it&#39;s Laurel &amp; Hardy&#39;s last one together and it&#39;s not their best? Or is it because of the lack of Laurel &amp; Hardy regulars? Or because it&#39;s not made by the Hal Roach studios or 20th Century Fox? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely true that this movie is not a successful attempt to revive Laurel &amp; Hardy and bring them to the &#39;50&#39;s. It&#39;s also definitely true that the movie is far from their best but honestly, the movie still entertains well, making this movie also far from their worst. Not the most worthy &#39;goodbye&#39; movie imaginable but an entertaining and suiting goodbye nevertheless. Both of them retired from movies after completing this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie still features some great slapstick moments and the chemistry between Laurel &amp; Hardy is obviously still very much present. It also makes this movie better than most of their movies together from the &#39;40&#39;s. Quite a surprise that the slapstick humor still works out as great as it does, considering that the days of slapstick comedy had been over, ever since the &#39;30&#39;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story is perhaps not as entertaining as it could had been and it features too many sidekicks and characters, with as a result that the movie looses its focus on the boys at times. A shame, because they are still the ones that really carry and make the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sad to see in what poor form Stan Laurel was at the time of making this movie. He really looked ill and old, which he also of course was. He was well over 60 years old already. But after a surgery he fully recovered and still lived for another 15 years, before dying in 1965, 8 years after his good friend Oliver Hardy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An entertaining, though not perfect goodbye to the boys, Laurel &amp; Hardy and the end of 3 decades of fun, humorous, quality slapstick entertainment of movies that are still being watched and loved by people all over the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7/10&#34;
b&#39;Non-stop action and just about every conceivable (and inconceivable!) sci-fi/horror cliche can be found in this blatantly silly but fun, big-budget epic. The pace never lets up, especially in the shorter US version, which tightens things up considerably.&#39;
b&#39;This version did not move me as deeply as the later, Hollywood version starring Anthony Hopkins and Debra Winger. While it was beautifully filmed and superbly acted, the BBC version was more packed with dialog that imparted information which I found fascinating. It gave me a detailed glimpse of the intellectual, theological and moral considerations that motivated C. S. Lewis. It was therefore more interesting and stimulating than the Hollywood version, but not nearly as visually stunning or viscerally affecting. Still, while I did not leave a heaping mound of sodden Kleenex in the theater, I did use one, and at frequent intervals. I enjoyed this film every bit as much as the Hollywood version, and was grateful for the increased understanding I gained.&#39;
b&#39;I felt compelled to give some feedback on this movie that I rented from Blockbuster. This movie has it all - comedy, drama, crime, suspense and &#34;realism&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie also had a lot of action with just the right amount of humor! I will definitely watch it again! There were some funny parts as well as action-packed drama. I enjoy movies that keep you wondering what\&#39;s going to happen next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The writer/director, Travis Milloy, should make more movies!!! In my overall opinion, this movie was great! I\&#39;m looking forward to his next one! Travis Milloy has real talent as a writer and director.&#39;
b&#39;&#34;Everything is Illuminated&#34; is like viewing a fine piece of museum quality artwork. It absolutely inundates the emotions through a very broad spectrum. Jonathan Safran Foer is played with candor by Elijah Wood. He is in search of his paternal heritage in the Ukraine. His travels bring him in contact with Alex, played very well and with extreme humor by Eugene Hutz. His grandfather is the most emotional tie to this film and he is aptly portrayed by Boris Leskin. If one finds little humor in the human characters in this cinema, then one has only to turn to Mikke, a real dog who is called Sammy Davis Jr. Jr. by Alex and his grandfather. They also call him the &#34;seeing eye bitch&#34;. The cinematography is spectacular. The colors are a very important part of the patchwork of the film. It is a film worth the time and emotional investment.&#39;
b&#34;Near-wonderful mixture of comedy, romance, and medical chaos has a 50-ish swinging-single doctor, tired of going to rock concerts with nubile airheads, dating a patient his own age whom he met on his rounds. Screenplay by Julius Epstein shows a fair amount of sophistication, though he doesn&#39;t have enough material to fill out the picture&#39;s last third, and one can almost feel the movie slipping. The subplot about the hospital being investigated for its shoddy business affairs isn&#39;t worked out satisfactorily, and it feels highly concocted anyway. Still, Walter Matthau and Glenda Jackson are a terrific team, Richard Benjamin and Art Carney very funny in support. Director Howard Zieff keeps it all popping, and even when Epstein&#39;s one-liners feel like Neil Simon rejects, Zieff zips right along happily. The results are dryly engaging and occasionally quite sweet. Followed by a failed TV series. *** from ****&#34;
b&#39;This Roscoe &#34;Fatty&#34; Arbuckle comedy is best remembered for featuring a young Buster Keaton, fresh from splitting with his family\&#39;s roughhouse Vaudeville act, in his film debut. Buster gets quite a substantial part in this film and it\&#39;s quite a funny one overall. &#34;The Butcher Boy&#34; has lots of laughs and is an example of pure old-fashioned slapstick done well, though it would seem to come from the brief era of two-reel comedies when filmmakers still imagined in one-reel segments as a matter of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first half of the film takes place in a general store, with Arbuckle as the the butcher boy of the title. It\&#39;s an excuse to mine the many possibilities for fast physical humor that a general store provides, and Arbuckle really shows himself to be a 300-pound acrobat, demonstrating subtlety, skill, and grace in his performance of what might have been unremarkable slapstick routines that raise them to a different level. A running gag has him flipping a large butcher knife casually so that it spins accurately into it\&#39;s proper position stuck into the cutting board, and I\&#39;m still stunned that Arbuckle really seems to do it each time. There\&#39;s also a really nice gag that sees him leaning on his scale and confused as to why his cuts of meat weigh so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buster Keaton is a boy who comes into to buy some molasses, and performs deftly in a foot-stuck-to-floor routine that follows. Apart from the odd and almost unsettling half-smile, his idiosyncratic attitude and body language make him recognizable immediately as the Buster we know. He even has his eventually-trademarked flattened hat -- here destroyed for the first time when filled, of course, with molasses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second half of the film moves into more situation-based comedy and Arbuckle and his rival Al St. John dress in drag to infiltrate Fatty\&#39;s girlfriend\&#39;s boarding school. A lot of the humor also comes from the generally surreal and mysteriously laugh-inducing sight of these two odd fellows wearing drag and trying to &#34;be girls.&#34; buster is in this segment too, but mostly stands there in the occasional cutaway, helping St. John.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ending of &#34;The Butcher Boy&#34; becomes a little emptily frenetic, but on the whole and beyond its historical curiosity interest, it\&#39;s a well-done comedy that gets just the knockabout laughs it is going for.&#39;
b&#34;This is one of Chaplin&#39;s First National films from the period between his glorious Mutual shorts and the more mature United Artists features. More opulent than the Mutual films, it continues Chaplin&#39;s quest for perfecting his comic expression. Most people forget that the film is actually a dream that Charlie has while awaiting being sent off to the front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is plenty of slapstick via the Limburger cheese being used to gas the enemy, and Chaplin&#39;s foray into enemy territory dressed as a tree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By this stage in this career, the great man had become so immersed in filmic expression that his films give the impression of making themselves. Doubtless this was not the case, but still, it gives as convincingly realistic view of life at the front as I can remember, albeit from an ironically humorous perspective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as I am concerned, familiarity with the entirety of Chaplin&#39;s work should be a prerequisite for all cinephiles - do not delay!&#34;
b&#34;My favourite story from &#39;tales from the crypt&#39;. Brion Jones was born to play the part of the maniac lumberjack,axe swinging madman Steve Dixon.Having seen him before in Tango&amp;Cash I can state this actor never got the proper credit he deserved. A jealous husband takes offence in his wife showing an interest in a hunky young worker he&#39;s just employed.And you know when Dixon finds out there&#39;s gonna be hell to pay!The young worker Ted(Billy Wirth)receives an almighty beating from Dixon leaving him blind.Now how is a blind lumberjack supposed to work? A tribute to black humour if there ever was one! The co stars do a pretty good job too supporting Ted when Dixon when he has his initial suspicions about his wife desiring another man.Dixon&#39;s behaviour making the bond stronger closer between the colleagues.One even stated he became a changed man when he got married.Though Ted should have done the wise thing and left when he could!&#34;
b&#34;We have moved far beyond this tentative foray into a forbidden area-drug addiction-for the 1950s. As such, the film may seem dated. The Man with the Golden Arm served its function is peeling back a layer of the underside of society, an eye-opener to a Southern country boy in 1955 when I first viewed this film in the theater. After some serious consideration about being too young, I was allowed to go. It was powerful and affecting then and still maintains some sharp, painful moments of the soul stripped naked. As a movie depicting the loneliness at the core of being, it succeeds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Filled with angst, Frank Sinatra, in his best role, creates a vulnerability that makes him sympathetic to the viewer. He conveys his helplessness and ineffectualness in a beautifully restrained performance. As a voice of common sense in the dead-end urban jungle, Kim Novak as Molly is quite good. She is compassionate and yet stands on solid ground. The interaction between Sinatra and Novak is really good. Darren McGavin plays a slimy character and does it very well. Eleanor Parker is superbly irritating and painfully insecure in her role of the pathetic Zosch, the crippled wife of Sinatra. Arnold Stang is another unlikely survivor of the street. Regarded as pitiful and despicable, his character Sparrow provides tart comedic moments. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The music is almost the star of this film-brooding, frenetic, moody, poignant. Elmer Bernstein&#39;s score perfectly accentuates the tensions of Frankie Machine&#39;s spiritual weakness and physical need for heroin. Molly&#39;s theme is bittersweet and captures aurally what the film depicts visually. I know of no other soundtrack that effectively complements the tension and defeat within a man as effectively as does this one.&#34;
b&#34;This was on the Saturday before Halloween this year (today, at the time of this writing) and it has to be the best horror anthology out there. I am normally not a fan of horror movies - largely due to the volume of crap that&#39;s been recently released. However, the director of Campfire Tales has the Hitchcock-esquire gift of suspense - unlike other contemporary films, it doesn&#39;t take every opportunity to scare you silly, instead using foreshadowing and &#39;near-misses&#39; - incidents that seem like the instant that the climax will occur in the instant before, but turn out not to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#39;t catch &#39;The Hook&#39; or the first main segment, but from what I have read here, they were the two you could afford to miss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;People Can Lick Too&#39; was full of suspense - this short keeps you on the edge of your seat, waiting for something to happen to the little girl as she wanders about her yard and house looking for her soccer ball and later her dog. She encounters so many near-misses that the suspense reaches heart-stopping proportions before the climax of the short, when the girl gives up and goes to bed, thinking her dog is underneath it. She reaches her hand down to let him lick it, and she feels the touch of a tongue on her hand...before noticing that on her mirror, written in blood, is &#39;People can lick too&#39;. I&#39;ll leave the last few seconds for you to find out, my reader, for at this point the short could have taken any number of turns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;The Locket&#39;, however, was the unarguable masterpiece of this film. It begins with a man on a motorcycle, simply driving...towards what he does not know, but he can feel himself getting closer. As he&#39;s driving along, a storm breaks out, and he&#39;s forced to find shelter in the house of a mute girl. The two quickly cozy up to each other, but before they can do anything besides kiss, the girl reveals through writing that ghosts inhabit her house. They quickly begin packing up to leave, but they are caught in the middle of a reenactment of a scene decades past - a father, coming home to his daughter and her boyfriend preparing to elope, murders the both of them and then commits suicide. I&#39;ll have to leave you to discover the ending here as well - I couldn&#39;t hope to do the story justice in any case, and what I&#39;ve said so far is just a brief summary of the story - I couldn&#39;t hope to convey the nuances and sensory details that add to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;The Campfire&#39;, being the connecting thread between all of the stories, is a fairly interesting rehash of the car accident theme, and the girls are very much attractive - in fact, most of the girls in this film are good-looking. Anyway, despite the fact that it&#39;s chopped up, the story is given justice, and the ending is difficult to predict if you&#39;re preoccupied with the other stories. However, if you pay enough attention to the segments of The Campfire spread through the film, it&#39;s certainly possible to predict the ending, especially if you&#39;ve seen movies based on the same premise. (MST3k fans, remember Soultaker? Same premise, but without the god awful writing of Vivian Schilling, and the bulk of the movie. If you&#39;ve seen the first 30 minutes of that you should be able to predict the ending.) All in all, the best horror movie I&#39;ve seen in a LONG time, and the only horror anthology worthy of a buy.&#34;
b&#39;It\&#39;s worth boning up on the Hindu pantheon before watching this film. Three main female deities -- wise Sita, nurturing Lakshmi and Kali the Transformer -- as well as three main male deities -- grave Rama, playful Krishna and Shiva the Ender -- are all alluded to. Knowing the folklore as surely every Indian member of an audience does lends a richness to the telling of the present-day story. In fact, one folktale is enacted first on stage, as part of a lesson in spirituality, and then in the movie\&#39;s &#34;real life.&#34; &#34;Fire&#34; speaks out against the misogyny and homophobia in the society to which its producers are native, and it does so with a beauty that weaves the message into multiple levels of the viewer\&#39;s awareness, making it a deeply satisfying presentation. This is the finest film i\&#39;ve seen in the past ten years; very highly recommended!&#39;
b&#39;I never thought I\&#39;d say this about a biopic, but there is a near over-abundance of characterization (especially concerning Kenji Miyazawa\&#39;s emotions) and too little on the literal occurrences in his life--by the end, I\&#39;m not sure if he dies (he\&#39;s supposed to), or if his sister finally dies (she\&#39;s supposed to), or if the director spent a little too much time on the Galactic Railroad (that\&#39;s an inside joke, in case you missed it--Miyazawa wrote a children\&#39;s book called Night on the Galactic Railroad). However, this glimpse inside the mind of a writer who &#34;sketched poetry and fairy tales from his imagination&#34; is very intelligent, creative, entertaining, and emotionally powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All this despite the fact that everyone is animated as animals (like in many of Miyazawa\&#39;s stories).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the visuals are truly astounding, especially considering that it was a made for TV movie. Seriously, some of them (like the sequence with birds trailing blue light) rival parts of Fantasia. However, I still can\&#39;t stand computer animation when it is mixed with cel animation. The CGI trains are horribly obvious--even more so than the Anastasia train.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8/10&#39;
b&#39;&#34;Nagisa no Shindobaddo&#34; or &#34;Like Grains of Sand&#34; is an amazingly beautiful story about teenage boys and girls dealing with the state of becoming one with who they are. This movie isn\&#39;t about homosexuality, but it IS about sexuality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aihara, an aloof girl, will definitely make the viewers ponder who IS behind the aloof girl. Does she love Yoshida? Or does she love Ito? Or did she somehow turn into a lesbian because of the &#34;incident&#34;? (I doubt it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And what about Yoshida? Does he realize that he loves Ito in the end? Well, we all know he loves him as a friend. But you\&#39;ll never know once you see this movie... haha :) In the end, Aihara (along with Ito) delivers an exceptional message to the audience: which is that it does NOT matter if you love a boy or a girl. And I have to tell you, I\&#39;m SO dense that I didn\&#39;t get it at first. ^^;; It\&#39;s because of the whole no talking scenes... You have to try to understand what the characters are thinking and saying through their actions and NOT by what they say (especially the final part... whew, boy, that was confusing!) It\&#39;s a confusing story, but it IS beautiful nonetheless. :) This movie is certainly one of the best Japanese movies I have ever seen (and trust me, I\&#39;ve seen plenty).&#39;
b&#34;This film was different. It took a sort of typical thriller story and reached for a more interesting, in-depth look at an individual character&#39;s struggle with faith. Of course, it helped that the main performance, by Andrew McCarthy, was quite excellent. The other performances were also quite interesting, although not as consistent. The ending was a bit of a let down, but there were lots of good moments. The film-makers tried something different here -- they didn&#39;t just go for the obvious chills and scares. This is a dark film (not for everyone) but if you want to be entertained and not talked down to, try this one.&#34;
b&#39;Here you see Mr. Eastwood in all of his glory (i.e., at the top of his form as an actor and at the height of his physical appeal), but the &#34;ladies&#34; depicted are hardly typical of the South, then or now. The young girls at the boarding school are incredibly naive, some showing signs of developing into really depraved women, and Geraldine Page, full-blown in her corruption, hardly represents the mean when it comes to head mistresses of girls schools, either then or now. (That is not to say that there isn\&#39;t the occasional bad apple in any barrel.) Mr. Eastwood has said this is one of his own two favorite films.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;The Beguiled&#34; does have an original plot, a lot of attractive characters and many surprises in store for the viewer. It\&#39;s thoroughly engrossing and entertaining but not really realistic. (I know, having grown up in the South and attended a girls\&#39; school and college. Moreover, I have been acquainted with innumerable girls who did the same, not to mention their laid-back teachers, or you might even say &#34;repressed professors&#34; who were a far cry from the headmistress depicted here.) She is downright comical in her depiction of a Southern gentle woman who is not quite what she seems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie was a little outrageous when it first appeared and still is, I think, but you won\&#39;t be sorry you spent your time watching it.&#39;
b&#34;i must say that this movie had a great cast, locations, music and camera work. Cameron Diaz was great, she had a very exciting roll, very uproarish, while Jordana Brewster had a serious roll yet still capturing one. for me Jordana&#39;s very nostalgic, she reminds of a female classmate of mine! what realy got me in this movie were the very skillfully planned camera work and the choosing of the locations. the story is very talently written. it is a must see one. the one&#39;s who are into mystery movies should watch this one, i guarantee you all that it&#39;ll keep you in your seats till the end.&#34;
b&#34;I have Never forgot this movie. All these years and it has remained in my life. I have looked for this movie on so many sites and stores. If anyone ever reads this and has a copy I will pay you for a copy of it or please let me know where I could find one. This is a movie that should be a Classic Romance known as well as my other favorite, Somewhere in Time. It was truly brilliant. If the right actors would remake this film and give it the Patience it needs, to be the Right acting, It could be a block buster.A Love story as powerful as this should be around for all lovers to see. I remember how sad I was at the ending and it really came as a shock. I believe with all my heart that Johnny really loved the woman and she him. This was one terrific movie and it is a shame that it is not available for us to purchase. Please contact me at shawe49@aol.com - I want to give my thanks to a wonderful lady that responded to my message almost a year later. She had a copy of the movie and was so kind to send it to me. She is a great fan of this movie as I am. With her help, there have been 3 happy ladies to receive these DVDs&#39;. She is waiting for the book that it is based on. I am checking with my local library for it, titled &#39;Mrs Maitlands Affair, by Margarett Lynn. I am sure it is great also. Many thanks to Julie for her graciousness and friendship. I am your friend always,/ Sharon&#34;
b&#39;Extraordinary Rendition is a frightening practice authorized, surprisingly, under Clinton, that allows the U.S. government to seize and hold anyone suspected, seemingly for any reason, of being a terrorist against the United States. This is a touchy issue, especially after 9/11, because supporters of the practice will always criticize the opposition as withholding vital power from the U.S. that it needs to effectively fight terror. Fanatic supporters will label the opposition as terrorists in themselves. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But like a recent film that lent a similar level of humanity to the death penalty, The Life of David Gale, Rendition shows us a story of the misuse of extraordinary rendition, or at least the ease with which it can be exploited and falsely applied. The story involves Anwar El- Abrahimi, an American chemical engineer born in Egypt who is seized on his way back to America from giving a lecture in Egypt. The cause given is that he made phone calls to a known terrorist. No proof is ever given (or needed) that it was Anwar that made the calls, that his phone was never lost of stolen. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, Anwar\&#39;s extremely pregnant wife, Isabella, is back in the states frantically trying to find her husband, who got onto a plane to Chicago but apparently never got off. The flimsy explanation that he was never there evaporates when she discovers that he made an in-flight purchase using his credit card. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lately I have been researching modern Chinese history, particularly that of the astonishingly selfish and brutal dictatorship set up by Mao Tse-tung, and it is more than a little frightening to see the similarities between extraordinary rendition and some of Mao\&#39;s brutal scare tactics, including his public executions (which the people were forced to watch), and extensive use of torture specifically used to extract &#34;confessions.&#34; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is pretty disturbing to notice that Mao specifically did these things to create an environment of fear in order to achieve obedience from the Chinese people. To say that the Bush administration has not created an environment of fear and continues to milk it for everything it\&#39;s worth would be na\xc3\xafve in the extreme, and although extraordinary rendition was not created under Bush, it is clear that it does more harm than good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adding to the thickness of the film is Douglas Freeman (Jake Gyllenhaal), who works behind a desk for the CIA and has little field experience, until his boss is assassinated and he suddenly finds himself supervising the torture of a man that he quickly comes to doubt has anything to reveal. Fatima\&#39;s (Freeman\&#39;s boss) daughter also plays a pivotal role, as does a senatorial aide played by Peter Sarsgaard, who might have the most satisfying role in the movie. Meryl Streep is also suitably cold and clinical as a chilly senator with a dogmatic support of the necessity and practice of rendition. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a political thriller, the movie is remarkably well-crafted and paced. But the scariest thing about it is that this is all real. The movie\&#39;s goal is to get people to really think about the things done in America\&#39;s name, especially when they claim to be done to prevent those same things. Conducting terror in the name of preventing terror will win no sympathy for us, nor will extracting confessions through brutal torture, which is the basest form of criminal investigation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, we are gradually heading in that direction, of doing these things more rather than less. The frightening question is what is the event that is going to take place at some point in the future to convince us to stop and head the other way, toward civilization and peace, or will we just keep heading toward a military dictatorship until we finally get there?&#39;
b&#39;One of the most macabre, depressing, yet eye-opening docs. I\&#39;ve watched in awhile. There\&#39;s no narration or story that\&#39;s told, just a &#34;third eye&#34; type camera following around 2 couples of heroin addicts in NYC through the seasons. Watching them shoot up on the floors of public washrooms then &#34;clean&#34; their needles in the public toilets... sometimes it\&#39;s a bit too much and you need to hit pause just to go for a breather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone currently in recovery of alcohol/drug addition should watch this when they\&#39;re craving - it really shows you to what you could be going back to! After seeing this it\&#39;s a wonder how anyone could even try this drug to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing it needed was a follow up at the end to tell where these people are today. Judging from what is shown in the doc., there\&#39;s no hope for any of them. They mention wanting to get better and quit, but it seems the only end to their habits is to quit by way of dying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This definitely isn\&#39;t for all audiences. I found myself kind of like watching a car accident - after I started watching it I just couldn\&#39;t turn it off. I had to keep watching with a dark/morbid fascination of what it\&#39;s like inside the lives of these addicts.&#39;
b&#39;One of my favorite villains, the Evil Princess is just the perfect villain for this movie. Full of space travel, horses, diamonds, mystical characters, colorful backgrounds, evil characters, etc etc. Very bright, full of action, you will not get bored. Great movie!&#39;
b&#39;The first ever fully synchronized sound cartoon, Walt Disney\&#39;s Mickey Mouse makes his screen debut in the exceptionally entertaining cartoon short subject &#34;Steamboat Willie&#34;. Mickey is a worker on a steamboat under the supervision of captain Peg Leg Pete(or Pete as he would later be called). Mickey boards his long time companion Minnie Mouse aboard the train as they frolic about, while Mickey attempts to impress Minnie. This short was wildly fun and positively entertaining. Animators Ubbe Iwerks, Rudolph Ising, and Hugh Harman assisted Walt on the creation of the short.&#34;Steamboat Willie&#34; essentially marks the beginning of the success of the Walt Disney Company.&#39;
b&#34;Good movie, great story, great characters, I enjoyed it immensely, enough to buy the DVD when it came out. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real life story it purports to tell is more fascinating and engrossing than anything the fictionalizers could ever come up with. My friend who is in the media business said they shouldn&#39;t show insider dealings like this, it gives the business a bad name. As if.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few problems with the DVD though: First, the sound volume is awfully low so you have to run up the TV volume to watch it. I notice that its also like that when HBO runs it so its in the original production copy. Second, for about the first five minutes the left side of the video is cut off, that is the picture is cut off about one inch short of the left side. After the five minutes it fills the screen properly, left to right. Sloppy technical production like that is very amateurish and I don&#39;t know why the director and producer let such sloppiness slide by.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, even with the technical flaws, its an enjoyable story, one of HBO&#39;s best I think.&#34;
b&#39;There are very few films that are able to tell such a complicated story on so many levels as well as Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters. One of the most difficult aspects of story telling is the ability to flashback and forward without losing the pace of the film. This film not only flashes back and fourth with the greatest of easy, but it also flows through some of Yukio Mishima greatest stories. This film exceeds in every aspect and is a joy to watch. Not to mention the incredible Philip Glass Soundtrack.&#39;
b&#34;This production was quite a surprise for me. I absolutely love obscure early 30s movies, but I wasn&#39;t prepared for the last 25 minutes of this story. If, by any chance, you&#39;re not convinced in the first half, hang in there for the finale. Of course, you must look at the blatant racism as being purely topical. A fascinating viewing experience, but I think THE CAT&#39;S PAW is not available on video/DVD yet. Watch your PBS listings!&#34;
b&#34;What do you do if you&#39;re Aishwarya Rai, coming off of a blockbuster film like &#39;Devdas&#39;, with some skeptical critics still relentlessly unsatisfied with your astounding performance or convinced by your strong screen presence and stellar acting skills, what do you do? Go home, sit down and pout? No. If you&#39;re Aishwarya Rai, you sign yourself up for the next strong period piece that comes along and continue to prove yourself worthy of all the praise, kudos, great scripts and equally great roles. And that&#39;s just what she did with and in &#39;Chokher Bali - a passion play&#39; where she stars and shines as Binodini, a young widow who causes controversy way ahead of her time. Directed by Rituparno Ghosh {who later goes on to direct her in the equally stellar &#39;Raincoat&#39;}, Prasenjit Chatterjee {Devdas in Bengali} costars.&#34;
b&#34;This is another classic Seagal movie. He walks, no, cruises through the patriot just all the other Mega Seagal movies. Nothing even comes close to challenging Seagal in this movie except maybe the part where he has to find a cure for this so called &#39;plague&#39; and he starts throwing things about the lab but it all works out, i mean lets face it, its Master Seagal, he&#39;s got to win. What about his outfit in the film, masterpiece, he must have picked it himself. Its great that everyone in the film is dying after being exposed to the virus but Seagal doesn&#39;t even get a cough. The incident at the end when he kills the fat guy with the broken glass, genius, i bet Seagal thought of that one as well. This film is class pure and simple. great plot, great characters, and Seagal.&#34;
b&#39;I always enjoy watching this cartoon, with Sylvester trying to catch Tweety on a train, rather than at Grandma\&#39;s house. It\&#39;s actually a standard fare, but entertaining, especially when Tweety pulls the emergency stop cord. One of my complaints about this is how sloppy the animators were with the train. When you watch this over and over, like my little boy did (who loves trains, which is why he liked it so much), you begin to notice some things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throughout this short, the position of the baggage car changes on the train, either 3rd, 4th or 5th, and in long shots not at all. The engine has either the number 651 or 814, or none at all. The coal tender has either the number 99, or the letters &#34;S.P. &amp; Q.R.&#34; on it, or no number or letters at all. The coaches carry the &#34;S.P.Q.R.&#34; without the &#34;&amp;&#34; in long shots, and then in closeups it has the words &#34;SouthEast and Western.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of this doesn\&#39;t interfere with the story, but the production details were obviously not looked into very carefully. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still this cartoon is among my favorites with Sylvester and Tweety.&#39;
b&#34;Well,I am a dancer so automatically I liked this film. The only thing I didn&#39;t like was they didn&#39;t have much dancing as I thought there would be. But I have to say the it was a good dance film. I think there should be more songs too. But it was a good film as i said before! My rating 9/10!&#34;
b&#39;This is an excellent B-film horror movie that borders between horror and comedy. It is about a genetically mutilated scorpion in outer space. Can it get more unreal? It is a hybrid between &#34;Alien&#34; and &#34;Chain Saw Massacre.&#34; The movie was shot in Stockholm with a mixed cast of Americans and Swedes that interact beautifully. Director Martin Munthe does a great job finding the comical highlights in this script and gets a few good laughs out of the audience. The movie was shot with little or no money and it is inspiring to see what can be done with limited resources. Stinger has all qualities of a B-film horror movie. It is comical and scary at the same time and the cast and crew are dedicated to their cause. It is great to see that movies like this can still be made! I would recommend seeing it if you like this type of films.&#39;
b&#39;The tagline on the box hails, &#34;100 TRAPPED PASSENGERS... 3,000 VENOMOUS VIPERS!&#34; You almost have to admire that degree of &#34;no chance in hell we\&#39;re ever going to deliver on this promise&#34; bullshit. I could admire The Asylum\&#39;s hucksterism more so if they made movies that, well, you know, were good or, at the very least, worth a damn. Haha, and it\&#39;s what I like about theses movies. They are garbage. You put them in a toilet and then you flush. It worth the price if you are a fan of cheesy movies. It may become a cult classic among many fans. The gore scenes are effectives, there\&#39;s not much I can say, it\&#39;s a Z flick that parody the new movie with Samuel L. Jackson, hell, it may be better so who knows!&#39;
b&#34;What&#39;s the point of this messages if not to discuss and share thoughts about the next season... Here is my forecast: 1. The hatch was indeed blown, but somehow everybody inside survived. Buts lets see about that. 2. The episode at the end with the tent is an observation team monitoring the tracking device installed on Desmonds boat by Penny. Now that the magnetic shield around the island was lifted, the signal was picked up by the observation station and they are going to send a rescue mission. 3. After the destruction of the hatch, the island is not isolated any more, and other ships/airplanes are going to arrive 4. The others are finally going to share their secret with us poor observers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was it actually confirmed that there are going to be 4 seasons of LOST?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers Mike&#34;
b&#39;A brilliant animated piece that was far ahead of its time, and certainly far ahead of anything that was being released in mass production at the same point in history. The influence of this work upon Tim Burton\&#39;s &#34;Nightmare Before Christmas&#34; is readily apparent. One can only imagine how Starewicz slaved over every beautifully detailed frame of this masterpiece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There have been very few animated films of this caliber. It\&#39;s a shame that more people haven\&#39;t seen this gem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently, IMdB now requires comments to be at least ten lines long, so this is the tenth line. This must be something new - but I really don\&#39;t have anything else to say!&#39;
b&#34;Although copies of this movie are hard to find, if you can find it, get it!! !!! I believe this was, aside from In The Navy, Abbott and Costello&#39;s only musical. Although they twisted the plot around a little, (I&#39;ve never heard a version where the butcher goes up with him), you still enjoy the antics of the slightly idiotic but lovable Jack, and the greedy butcher, Mr. Dinklepuss. Slightly reminiscent of DuBarry Was a Lady, this uproarious film will have you rolling on the floor - only to get up and dance as Lou Costello sings. (I don&#39;t know why they didn&#39;t do that in other films.)&#34;
b&#34;We loved this movie because it was so entertaining and off beat-- Not your usual Hollywood drivel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband had a Blockbuster coupon and passed on a string of new releases of violent Hollywood stuff. He was about to walk out when he saw this and decided to take a chance. There was only one copy -- and with some glitches in the DVD that we finally had to flip to wide screen version and then back to the full screen version to make it stop stalling. But it was worth it. Cathy Bates is so good and she was so perfect for the role. And she can sing too! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If only Hollywood would learn from Independent film makers! Maybe we would go back to the real movies. But for now, we&#39;re sticking with off beat and really entertaining films like this one! Other examples we&#39;ve enjoyed include: A Box Full of Moonlight, Pieces of April, Delivering Milo, The Celestine Prophesy. Most of the ones by Christopher Guest such as: Best in Show, For your Consideration, A Mighty Wind, and Waiting for Guffman&#34;
b&#39;Robert Montgomery and Robert Young are outstanding as a duo of young submarine officers stationed in Italy during World War I. The dialog is highly entertaining, and Jimmy Durante is hilarious as the ship\&#39;s cook, &#34;Ptomaine&#34;. Walter Huston\&#39;s character is inspiring as the captain of the submarine, a stellar example of an officer and a gentleman. One of the most interesting aspects of this movie was the level of technology displayed in the battle scenes. I was surprised at how similar the technology of World War I was to the technology displayed 25 years later in World War II. Basic human nature was portrayed as very similar to modern times, and far from the conservativism I thought existed in the so-called &#34;innocent&#34; past. All in all I felt that the cast, characters, action scenes, and view of history depicted in this movie were first-rate.&#39;
b&#39;This movie starts out a little slow but kicks into comedic gear quickly. Each of the three &#34;teenage girls&#34; offer their own believable, distinct, assertive and entertaining personalities. I particularly enjoyed the dialog and interaction between Keith and Lisa. If one looked beyond the superficial &#34;action&#34; that was taking place, Keith\&#39;s character treated Lisa\&#39;s &#34;deflowering&#34; with tenderness and consideration. The comic development that followed was also pulled in expertly in my opinion. David Boreanaz gives a wonderful performance as the adult male who clearly gets himself into more trouble than he can handle. Dialogue was sharp, quick and flowed nicely. The director and writer of this film clearly showed how none of the main characters got to claim the moral high ground after all the shenanigans they pulled. Although the movie appears light on the surface, it reflects all the gray areas of becoming an adult, human emotions and desire.&#39;
b&#34;This is, by far, the best movie I&#39;ve seen in a long while. It is a wholly original and beautiful plot. It is not boring, nor is it too dramatic. The characters are tangible and realistic, but it does not take away from the story line. The fact that is not in English is most likely the final touch. The end leaves you fulfilled in a way I&#39;ve never experienced in a movie before. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had found this movie earlier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;more lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;more lines a lot more lines c&#39;mon, i&#39;m done&#34;
b&#34;Although I was hoping that I&#39;d like it a little more, this was still certainly an impressive film. There were great performances by all the leads, and the story, while not what I&#39;d call chilling, was still effective and it kept me interested. For me, the best part of this film was the look of the picture, for it always looked cold and damp and it just really seemed to suit the film well. I also thought that the low budget suited this movie, for I don&#39;t think that a crisp picture and clear sound would have worked as well in a film this grim. All things considered, it fell a little short of my expectations, but I&#39;m still very glad that I finally sat down to watch this movie.&#34;
b&#39;Tom Fontana\&#39;s unforgettable &#34;Oz&#34; is hands down one of the greatest television series ever created. Brilliantly written, acted, and directed it is as close to perfection in any art form (film, television, literature, music) as it gets. Haunting in it\&#39;s extreme brutality it creates a prison world filled with diverse characters that range from compassionate to flat out terrifying. It is a show that no matter how brutal it is get through, one cannot take its eyes off of. The combination of professional trained theater actors with film and television actors allows for a range of diverse and all original performances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And while the show is universally praised and has/had a loyal fan base, one cannot feel that it was under-appreciated during it\&#39;s television run because of other HBO dramas such as &#34;The Sopranos&#34;, &#34;Sex and The City&#34;, and &#34;Six Feet Under&#34;. And while all those shows are fine and borderline masterpieces in their right, many people forget that it was &#34;Oz&#34; that was HBO\&#39;s first entry into one-hour television drama series. It was a brave, risky first entry and with it HBO hit a grand slam with it. This is as good as it gets.&#39;
b&#34;I didn&#39;t understand what that line meant... I do now. I didn&#39;t really want to see Dirty Dancing either. I&#39;d rented it out but never watched it - and today I did. And I thought it was a really fun, great movie that makes you want to get up and dance. Alright, it was cheesy at times... but it&#39;s still a great movie. I can&#39;t believe Jennifer Grey was 27 in this movie - my friend and I thought she looked about 18 or 19 - 20 at the most. I guess this is attributed to her acting talent. And she did really look awkward at times. Patrick Swayze is also very good, but you can tell he is in his thirties and seems a bit old. Nevertheless, still very good. I love 80s songs so it really struck a chord with me, and the love story (yes, I&#39;m a romantic) was so wonderfully done. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Exceeded my expectations!&#34;
b&#39;This is a great little movie, full of interesting characters and situations. While not in the same class as some of the better-known movies of its time, it is still extremely watchable and memorable. The scene where Zachary Scott, sitting on a bus, casually steals the airman pin from the lapel of a coat thrown over the seat next to him, is terrific. It defines his character beautifully -- a guy who\&#39;s so low, he\&#39;ll purloin something of inestimable value to a war veteran, to use as a prop in his various charades. He lies easily as the situation calls for, and captivates the women in the Fenchurch household with his irresistible charm and that killer smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn\&#39;t help wondering if this movie was made to capitalize on the success of Mildred Pierce. Scott and Bruce Bennett were teamed again, and Faye Emerson bears some resemblance to Joan Crawford, with her facial bone structure and large eyes. Also, the Mona Freeman character is not unlike the odious Veda in Mildred Pierce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with a previous comment that the ending to the movie was too pat, with the convenient tumble over a cliff for &#34;Ronnie Mason&#34;, Zachary Scott\&#39;s character. Also, in one of the final scenes, we see bratty Mona Freeman reunited with the boyfriend she had previously scorned in favor of the older, smoother Zachary Scott. I think the script should\&#39;ve called for her to be chastened for her behavior and for her cruelty toward her sister, instead of treating it as just a typical adolescent episode. But these are minor flaws in an otherwise enjoyable and well-made movie.&#39;
b&#34;Who should watch this film? Anyone who has ever taken acid, read Philip K. Dick, thought the premise of the Matrix was better then the special effects, has an interest in Philosophy, or likes having their sense of reality messed with. I laughed out loud at this film, just because it was so outrageous and so spot-on. This film is great. This film is cool. It is better than the Matrix, by a long shot (I didn&#39;t fall asleep in Existenz, for a kick off: action/special effects films bore me stupid, and despite a plausible philosophical gloss, that is exactly what the Matrix is). Existenz is gross, it is disturbing, and it is funny. David Cronenberg has done some shonky stuff (Rabid) and some works of genius too (Videodrome is another one worth checking out, as is Stephen King adaptation The Dead Zone). But this is one of my all-time favourites. I can&#39;t remember the ending- which is a good thing, cos it means I can watch it again. Or perhaps I never watched this film at all. Maybe it&#39;s an implanted memory. Or maybe it &#39;really&#39; happened to me. I don&#39;t know. At any rate, it is now seamlessly stitched into my overall illusion of reality, and I&#39;m glad.&#34;
b&#34;I can&#39;t believe I missed this one. Made in 1970 with a budget that would probably allow you to make one indifferent episode of a TV soap, this is 90 minutes of sustained, sharp as a knife film making. You will find the outline, plot etc elsewhere on this site.Consider though that the whole thing was shot using a single, hand- held,16mm camera... all the dialogue is improvised... none of the &#39;actors&#39; had appeared in front of a camera before... It sounds like a recipe for disaster. Instead what we get is hippies v cops running around in the California desert in what evolves into a &#39;that&#39;s not fair.. i&#39;m on that person&#39;s side&#39;scenario. The only problem is, the director keeps making you shift your allegiance and at the end of 90 minutes we&#39;re still not sure who has one. Brilliant... Quite brilliant.&#34;
b&#34;For a movie shot in 18 days and a budget less than 2 million, this little movie that could deserves a &#39;best we could&#39; award. Interesting premise (aside from the usual meteor stuff) with solid perfs by a cast of familiar faces. 2 thumbs up. Advice to the other reviewer: Don&#39;t be afraid to say you liked something.&#34;
b&#39;This film is excellent! Fear of watching documentary movies? Cancel your shrink and watch little Dieter\&#39;s story. You won\&#39;t believe how captivating this fine piece of film making is until you have experienced it. I\&#39;m eager to say that it even out goes almost any Vietnam war movie, including Apocalypse Now. It\&#39;s a real story, it\&#39;s a personal story, a story about the love for flying, the dream of being a pilot and the nightmare of being shot down above enemy\&#39;s territory. All is shot in a &#34;return to...&#34; style - at location, Herzog asking the questions, Dieter answering them in a memorable German-English accent, and with fine remembrance pointing out what happened where about 25 years before. There is this part that I told friends over and over again: bailed out from his US Navy plane, Dieter becomes a POW of the Vietcong. Blindfolded for the greater part of the days, he is being dragged through the Southeast Asian jungle for miles and miles - on bare feet. Tortured, insulted, disorientated, hungered and covered with infectuous wounds, they arrive in a small, friendly village to spend the night. The next morning, after walking for several hours, Dieter discovers someone stole his wedding ring from his finger. That is it. He can take no more. He starts to cry, as a result of complete exhaustion. The Vietcong men react surprised. Dieter manages to explain what happened. Immediately, the group returns to the village and starts searching for the person that stole the ring. They find the man, immediately chop of his finger and return the ring to Dieter. - The movie is full of these mind boggling and surprising situations. The immense cultural differences, the clash of East and West, the fear of the unknown (i.e. all that stands for America on the one hand, the Asian jungle and his secrets on the other) can be sensed the entire movie. Back problems? That\&#39;s because you sat at the edge of your seat for two hours and didn\&#39;t notice.&#39;
b&#34;After the highs of darkplace it was never conceivable that Holness and Adobye would be able to create anything half as good as garth marengi. Yet i think that man to man in its own right is as good a show (on the good episodes) as darkplace. i cant argue that 2 of the episodes really are&#39;nt that good but the other 4 certainly make up for it. if i had to pick 2 great episodes id go for formula4 driver Steve Pising (pronounced Pissing) and the great Garth Marengi. to already have a bit of understanding of the programme is a real plus as Dean Learner makes many inside jokes but even if you have&#39;nt seen much Dean id recommend this as some of the rants he launches into are genius ie. His argument with Def Lepord over their name. All in All a great show which just misses full marks because of the couple of less funny episodes.&#34;
b&#34;The success of SCREAM gave birth to a whole new horror flicks wave. I&#39;m happy with that, as a big fan of horror, and I liked most of those new horror films. BOC is a one big pack of horror. Colorful, fast paced and original. I see this movie more like the opening of a new trilogy (much like Episode 1 and Aliens: Resurrection) since it comes up with a new twist. Instead of focusing on the little boy-killer doll relationship we have here a twisted movie about couples. We have the sweet young lovers in contrast with the killer crazy doll-sized lovers. Very inventive!&#34;
b&#34;&#39;The Dresser&#39; is one of those films which are so perfect you really struggle to find something not to like about them. Written by Ronald Harwood (himself a former dresser to the legendary Donald Wolfit), it sparkles with energy and true love of life behind the footlights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As &#39;Sir&#39;, the overbearing actor and main focus of the play, Albert Finney is a joy to watch - whether complaining about the lack of a storm during the &#39;blow, winds ...&#39; bit of &#39;King Lear&#39; or chatting to his faithful stage manager, Madge (Eileen Atkins, good as ever) about the old times. As Norman, his camp dresser, Tom Courtenay gives a fabulous performance, wiggling around at the beck and call of &#39;Lear&#39;, collecting a bottle to go at the pub, or bitchily disparaging the former Fool, Mr Davenport-Scott (often mentioned, but never seen!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an engaging support cast, there&#39;s Edward Fox as Oxenby (a typical arrogant second lead), Zena Walker as her Ladyship, Lockwood West as the replacement Fool, and many others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film has great energy, bringing with it some of the greasepaint of its stage origins, it is true, but being so well-acted you don&#39;t notice. Very well done indeed.&#34;
b&#39;Until I saw this film, &#34;life is beautiful&#34; was my favourite film of all time. This film is everything a great film should be. Great script, unsurpassed acting and direction that neither approaches the sentimentalism the subject tempts nor leaves it without the emotional impact it demands. This film contains the taste that could not come from Hollywood and lacks the pretencion that would come from France. A wonderful movie even above the calibre I have come to expect when I see the handmade films logo come up. I need not go into detail as the previous posts encompass everything why this movie has to be seen by everyone on this planet.&#39;
b&#34;GZSZ is the longest running daily soap in Germany and it&#39;s cult! I started watching it from the first day on and I got hooked on it right from the start. Over the years so much has changed, the old characters like Heiko, Elke, Tina, Saskia etc. left, and new ones appeared like Marie, Kai, Cora or John. I have to say that I liked GZSZ better in the years 1995-2000 because today the show focuses too much on the younger characters. My favorite character is Sonja Wiebe because she is the most scheming person that has ever been on that soap and she is also one of the most interesting characters on the show. Tina Bordihn was great as the first Sonja but as Tokessa became the recast of Sonja the character got even better.&#34;
b&#39;George Cuckor, known as a director of women, couldn\&#39;t have hoped for two more talented and beautiful women for his last film. Itself a remake of Bette Davis\&#39; campy &#34;Old Acquaintance&#34; written by John Van Druten, this film is definitely dated, but still delightful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bergen and Bisset sparkle as best friends who compete at everything, but manage to remain friends. Liz Hamilton (Bisset) is a &#34;serious&#34; writer, intellectual, and elegant. She meets her lifelong best friend Merry Noel at an exclusive girls school and they begin a lifetime of not always friendly competition. Later in their lives, when Liz is a &#34;promising&#34; but blocked writer of serious fiction, Merry decides to try her hand at writing, which infuriates her pal because of Merry\&#39;s casual approach to the craft she herself takes perhaps a little too seriously. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much to Liz\&#39;s chagrin, Merry\&#39;s trashy novels hit pay dirt, and ultimately, her old friend Liz is judging her novel for the National Book Award. Bergen steals the show as the haughty writer of steamy bestsellers who schemes to bring together the broken pieces of her life in conjunction with her final literary triumph, but alas, things are never that simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The supporting cast includes David Selby, whom you might remember as the tragic Quentin Collins from Dark Shadows, Hart Bochner and, of course, a deliciously young and mercurial Meg Ryan in her first film role since leaving the soaps. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rich and Famous is catty, campy, witty and wise. It culminates in a New Years fiasco that stresses the enduring nature of true friendship, and I never let a year go by without watching it on New Years Eve. Watch it and you\&#39;ll see why.&#39;
b&#34;**1/2 Elisha Cuthbert, Chad Michael Murray, Brian Van Holt, Paris Hilton and Jon Abrahams. Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet another classic horror film remade with dunder-headed teenage acting despite grizzly and creative deaths. Based on the 1953 Vincent Price film House of Wax where a maniac kills unsuspecting teenage hooligans and turns them into priceless wax figures. Still with the fantastic set design to make the whole house into wax the movie is a typical classic horror remake like Tobe Hooper&#39;s 1974 classic Texas Chainsaw Massacre later remade, despite creativity and so-so acting the movie was still just a gore picture. Director Serra showed mild enthusiasm with his directing but still worth watching. My final rating 7/10.&#34;
b&#39;Barbara Stanwyck probably didn\&#39;t think of it, but it is a relief to see her in a more becoming dark hairstyle (if it wasn\&#39;t a wig) than the one she had to wear in &#34;Double Indemnity&#34; the year before. That film, while the premiere &#34;film noir&#34; and an all-around great film, gave her a great role, but oh, that hair. Here, she is more chic and certainly no femme fatal, but she is certainly a 40\&#39;s woman. She has gotten used to life without men since most of them are off at war, and as a successful Martha Stewart like columnist, she writes a homey column in which she describes her country home as the camera pans over what it really is. We meet her boss, Sydney Greenstreet, who has no idea that she is living a lie, and when he pushes his way in for a Christmas away at her supposed Connecticut home, she has to come up with a husband (Reginald Gardiner) and baby before we can say &#34;Jingle Bells&#34;. Hungarian chef S.Z. Sakall steps in to help and ends up in a cutsey pie one-on-one with Irish Una O\&#39;Connor. &#34;It\&#39;s not Goulash, It\&#39;s Irish Stew&#34;. Sakall simply takes the paprika, pours most of it in, and says, &#34;Now it\&#39;s goulash&#34;, totally changing what she has prepared for lunch. Then, when it comes to the flapjacks, he flips and she scoops. For years, a few friends of mine and I will use that line every time pancakes come up in a conversation. &#34;I don\&#39;t flip. I scoop!&#34;. She won\&#39;t even flip just one for Greenstreet, saying &#34;I\&#39;ve never flipped in me life.&#34; O\&#39;Connor can get on the nerves when she screeches over and over in some films, but here, she is delightfully lovable, and her pairing with Sakall is very charming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is obvious in the romance department that Reginald Gardiner is not Barbara Stanwyck\&#39;s cup of tea, especially when she meets handsome Dennis Morgan, who is a bit dimwitted when bathing the baby, which eats soap, causing Stanwyck to get a bit alarmed. He should suspect something instantly, but doesn\&#39;t. But it doesn\&#39;t matter. The film is so charming with the country setting filled with snow, an abundance of rocking chairs, and a dog running towards them as the sleigh comes up. Living in New York City after 25 years in Los Angeles after growing up in a small town on the western side of New York State made me miss this kind of Christmas. While Central Park is beautiful after a first snow and the Christmas tree at Rockefeller Center is exsquisit too, there is something about looking out at a snow-covered field of trees, and catch an occasional glimpse of deer, rabbits, or other wild life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great holiday film that can also bring on the Christmas spirit out of season, and makes a great pairing with another Barbara Stanwyck country Christmas film, &#34;Remember the Night&#34;, an underrated gem. Add on the big city Christmas of &#34;Meet John Doe&#34;, and you\&#39;ve found perhaps one of the busiest stars of holiday films around.&#39;
b&#34;I&#39;ll make this brief. This was a joy to watch. It may or may not have been more effective if the characters had resembled their real life counterparts, but aside from this minor observation I found the fantasy animal characters to be most enjoyable. The visuals were most stunning except for the second-rate CG scenes, which could have been left out. I dislike computer generated animation anyways, it defeats the purpose of a biopic such as this one. Watch it, you will appreciate it too!&#34;
b&#39;Since frame number 1 you know the good guy in the suit and necktie is doomed\xc2\x85 He has no luck (&#34;Sorte Nula&#34;), or so he believes with that music on the car radio, and the dubious talk by his best friend and company associate who is taking him to parts unknown through a desert road. Alberto wished simply to be left alone, to take a flight abroad next day, with\xc2\x85 well, someone we\&#39;re left guessing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film goes a long way \xc2\x96 that\&#39;ll find short \xc2\x96 to a closing scene with the man hearing the same music on a cab to the airport. In between, a number of lucky people have found different ways out of the story, some dying, some being born, others falling into harrowing distress. This time he\&#39;s really doomed\xc2\x85 Or is he? The film is a sort of one-man show by director Fernando Fragata who only left the sound recording and the special effects to other, competent people. Those who typically reject Portuguese films due to sound problems and unclear speech recording, must go searching for other topics to criticize this time. The car crash (this isn\&#39;t spoilers, the film is too clever for THAT) makes for a great scene, and apparently was done with cheap equipment. (US Studios take notice: you may spare a dollar or two by hiding competent Portuguese directors!) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest was done by Fragata, from the script to the dialogue, from camera work to editing. If part of the dialogue were ad-libbed, then he again must be congratulated for the acting direction, and the casting with mostly inexperienced actors. A large number of non-speaking parts are credited, but most of those people were used for the music video clip and the making of, used extensively in the film\&#39;s promotional trailer. The cast has a dozen actors and actresses, of whom ten relevant persons, and a huge number of relationships \xc2\x96 that are revealed step-by-step, in a thrilling, suspenseful way, reminiscent of the best genre authors. \&#39;Alfred Hitchcock\&#39; (qv) and \&#39;Claude Chabrol\&#39; (qv) do come to mind, by the cat-and-mouse play between the director and his public, and the nature of his characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this thriller and comedy to Portuguese language speakers and, if the film gets to have a decent translation of its colloquial dialogue, to anyone abroad who enjoys those genres.&#39;
b&#39;After 10 viewings in 20 years I too think this was the Crazy Gang\&#39;s best effort on film, with more cohesion in the plot than their next best, &#34;Alf\&#39;s Button Afloat&#34;. They were indeed a crazy trio of double acts thrown together mainly on stage, sometimes in front of royalty, until Chesney Allen retired in the \&#39;40\&#39;s through &#34;ill-health&#34;. He outlived them all by years. Apparently they were just as mad outside &#34;work&#34;, regularly playing practical jokes on one another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Six Wonder Boys troupe head for I\&#39;ll-Get-Her-To-Tell-Me (Alaska) to dig for the gold that was being found there. It seemed a better idea than going to Mansfield ... because they\&#39;d been there. When they get to Red Gulch they find their information was a mere 40 years out of date - they thought that the chips that were in the guilty newspaper they\&#39;d read tasted funny. But by then it doesn\&#39;t matter as they\&#39;ve all fallen in love with Snow White and want to help her grandad find his long lost stash of gold. Baddie Bill &#34;M&#34; McGrew wants it himself however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The number of verbal and visual puns is astonishing, but most of them will probably only make sense(?) to Brits and ex-pats interested in seeing \&#39;30\&#39;s British b&amp;w comedies. Imho nearly all of the gags and routines work, including the Gold If patter between Bud &amp; Chesney and the &#34;Whistle While You Work&#34; pastiche - even the &#34;Always Getting Our Man&#34; Mountie inserts. A marvellous little film, in a rather tired looking condition but utterly recommended.&#39;
b&#39;A lovely librarian, played by Playboy model Kristine DeBell, falls asleep and dreams herself into a strange world filled with extremely uninhibited people\xc2\x85 These people love to sing and dance and fool around\xc2\x85 Alice has a series of sensual adventures among these characters\xc2\x85 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film was originally shot as a poem to eroticism with few explicit sex scenes, which were eventually cut from its theatrical release\xc2\x85 Videocassette versions, however, have had some of the original erotic encounters joined at the end with them\xc2\x85 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For an extremely low-budget picture, the producers of this film did an extremely good job\xc2\x85 The cinematography is full of life and energy, the dances and numbers quite professional, and the acting lovable\xc2\x85 Without a doubt, it is one of the best adult fairy tales around\xc2\x85&#39;
b&#34;This Columbo is unique in that we don&#39;t really know the exact outcome until the very end. Our favorite dark horse detective suspects a pair of identical twin brothers of killing their rich uncle; each points the finger at his brother. In a mystery series in which the crime is shown at the beginning of the drama, this twist could reasonably be used only once or twice, and this was Columbo&#39;s time. Other than that wrinkle, this episode fits in well with others of the series. It has a lighter tone than some, with a very funny performance by Jeanette Nolan as the fastidious and loyal housekeeper who takes an instant dislike to Columbo.&#34;
b&#34;Dad (78) and I (46) both had a good time watching the flick today. For a guy primarily known for serious roles, De Niro is a heckuva comic actor. Of course, it helps to have his past film images to play against. Consider that one of those roles, 15 MINUTES, was a cop having to deal with the interference of the mass media, and you have an interesting set of compare/contrast performances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Murphy plays another of his Axel Foley sort of characters. Shatner plays a burlesque of himself, a parallel world self who was best known for TJ HOOKER and not STAR TREK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s interesting to watch how the film comments on the contrasts between the reality of police work and its fictional counterparts in TV and film. Shatner lectures on the proper means of sliding across a car hood; De Niro points out holsters scratch the hood finish. Ironically, as the film progresses, De Niro&#39;s character begins to incorporate the illusions of TV-cop reality into the real world case he&#39;s working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film draws its inspiration from a gamut of sources, so one could make the comment it is derivative. Well, so what? Satire needs to derive its humor in order to exist. And besides, the film does have quirky moments of originality. For example, I&#39;m reasonably sure the method of the villain&#39;s death has never been done before. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One quibble about the reality of the weapons involved-- shouldn&#39;t those guns have had some kind of recoil? In order to penetrate steel, those bullets had to have enough inertia to penetrate. And any bullet&#39;s highest level of inertia is at the moment of firing. So.... firing a volley of these tank-killer bullets should have driven the shooters back onto their butts. Oh, what the heck... it&#39;s a satire. Maybe the guns&#39; lack of recoil is itself a satire on the B-F-Guns used so casually in thrillers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;
b&#34;I am a Christian, and thought this movie was pretty good! :) While the acting wasn&#39;t Academy Award caliber, I thought it was good, considering the cast has had limited acting experience at the time this movie was made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gospel message and the transforming power of Jesus Christ was explained wonderfully. The message that the director was trying to get across (which is THE important thing, not how the characters dressed!) definitely got through. The theme of having the main characters involved in illegal drag racing was a good idea, too (cool muscle cars, btw). I think this movie will definitely reach out to a lot of young people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this movie, it is a great witnessing tool! :)&#34;
b&#39;Although I\&#39;m not crazy about musicals, COVER GIRL is a delight for classic movie buffs and especially for fans of Rita Hayworth and Gene Kelly. The film may be dated by today\&#39;s standards and the story and songs may be nothing special, but the musical numbers are magnificently staged and there\&#39;s a terrific cast to go with the film. Plus, the film is a worthy introduction for fans of Rita Hayworth...she\&#39;s simply breathtaking in glorious Technicolor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite Jerome Kern\&#39;s collaboration with the film, his music here is nowhere near as special or memorable as his songs in SWING TIME (1936), yet the songs serve the film well. The dancing is nothing short of excellent, especially coming from Gene Kelly\&#39;s solo number and my favorite musical number, &#34;Alter-Ego Dance.&#34; The amusing Phil Silvers nearly steals the film as Kelly\&#39;s partner. Otto Kruger, Eve Arden, and Edward Brophy give good performances in their dramatic supporting roles. And Rita plays a sweet, charming girl here; a role that\&#39;s a far cry from her femme fatale babes in films like BLOOD AND SAND (1941).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a delightful film that\&#39;s worth watching even if you\&#39;re not big on musicals. Yet the film\&#39;s music could have been more memorable if only my favorite period songwriters, Irving Berlin or Cole Porter, wrote the songs for this film. However, it\&#39;s the glorious Technicolor cinematography and the imaginative dancing that are the real treats of the film\&#39;s production.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I was watching Rita Hayworth do her stuff, I don\&#39;t think I\&#39;ve ever seen a more beautiful or graceful redhead dance on the screen since I saw Moira Shearer in Michael Powell\&#39;s masterpiece, THE RED SHOES (1948). Just watch Rita in COVER GIRL and fall in love with her.&#39;
b&#39;I was first introduced to this movie while in San Antonio, Tx. This movie was the 2nd. in a double feature. Unfortunately, the theater where I saw this was torn down. Anyways, Five Fingers of Death (aka: King Boxer), was released in 1972 and introduced in the U.S. the following year. Like a lot of &#34;other&#34; Kung-Fu movies released while riding on the &#34;coat-tails&#34; of Enter the Dragon, this particular movie actually was pretty good. It\&#39;s the story of a country boy who is sent to a martial arts institute to better himself &amp; his fighting skills. Meanwhile, the &#34;opponent&#34; martial arts school plans &amp; scheme to thwart our hero, utilizing dirty tactics to try to throw him off track &amp; try to prevent him from participating in the tournament. By surprise, I had thought since Warner Bros. distributed this movie in the U.S., Warner Bros. was going to issue a DVD. It never happened. As far as I know, this movie has been released in both English &amp; Cantonise, w/sub-titles.....the latter a more &#34;cleaner &amp; clearer&#34; version. Although the fighting sequences are a bit funny to watch (i.e.: flying in air &amp; hitting, jumping on buildings, a fighter using his head....literally....to hit his opponent, etc.), nonetheless, it\&#39;s classic kung-fu action wonderfully planned &amp; executed. If you like Enter the Dragon, Five Fingers of Death would be an excellent addition to any Movie collection.....if you can find it.&#39;
b&#39;For those curious, this episode is based in theme upon Pirandello\&#39;s play, &#34;Six Characters in Search of an Author&#34; and Jean-Paul Sartre\&#39;s play, &#34;No Exit&#34; (as indicated most obviously by its title), but, of course, with a Sterling twist. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five very different individuals find themselves in a round room with no idea who they are other than the indication of their attire. A bell intermittently rings (perhaps also a Hemmingway allusion?), increasing the agony of their incarceration. The newcomer to the group, a Major, is determined to escape, while the others are resigned to their fate. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike Pirandello, these characters don\&#39;t even have a story. They have nothing other than the experience of the room in their consciousness, and no one to author their nonexistent story, so their position is even more hopeless than the characters in Pirandello\&#39;s piece. Unlike both Pirandello and Sartre, there is no relationship involved between the characters and therefore no real conflict between them, though the theme of personal responsibility versus apathy is prominent in this story. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though this diverges significantly from the storyline of the authors alluded to in the title, themes of Sartre and Pirandello (and many other authors of the twentieth century) come through with absolute clarity. This is very obviously a piece which addresses post-modernist perspective in the context of the Cold War era. There is also an emphasis upon issues of personal insignificance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is easily one of the best episodes I\&#39;ve seen, and still exceptionally relevant to current experience (as are Sartre and Pirandello). Exactly what makes a good piece of writing into a classic.&#39;
b&#39;A true stand out episode from season 1 is what Ice is.An artic location,claustrophobic conditions and a general feel of paranoia looming in the freezing air makes this is a must see episode from season one.The previous occupants of the artic station Mulder,Scully and four others go to have either killed each other or killed themselves.A virus is bringing out murderous aggression and is responsible for bringing out deadly paranoia and fear.Mulder and Scully actually begin to question each others sanity.Tension is that high.The writers have to receive great credit for creating that sort of scenario where the atmosphere is so tense Mulder and Scully come into conflict in such a direct manner&#39;
b&#39;First of all, I have watched this show since I was a little toddler, and I have always loved it. Sure, maybe I didn\&#39;t understand it when I was that young, but I still enjoyed it! And now that I have been able to understand it for several years, I love it even more. The score of this musical is the most wonderfully detailed score I have ever heard! Every note is perfect, I don\&#39;t even need to hear the singing to enjoy it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moving on to this particular production- This is magnificent! Of course no one could play Mrs. Lovett besides Angela Lansbury, and she does it perfectly. And she should, she has been playing this part for several years. George Hearn is absolutely brilliant. The best Sweeney Todd I have ever heard. He has a wonderful voice, yet he can throw his voice so well! His &#34;epiphany&#34; is incredible, as you can tell by the audience\&#39;s reaction to it. The Judge, Toby, Antony, and Pirelli are also so wonderful in their roles. Everyone is perfect! Well, I still have to fast forward through Johanna\&#39;s Green finch and linnet bird. She just doesn\&#39;t sing that song well at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This show CAN be appreciated at all ages, but it is not always accepted. I am not your typical middle-aged theater lover, I am only 15 years old, yet Sweeney Todd has given me a greater appreciation for music than I have gotten from any other musical.&#39;
b&#34;Anthony Minghela&#39;s (writer/director) Cold Mountain is a carefully constructed, sensitive, and intelligent drama set in the social context of the confederacy during the civil war, which deals with the politics of the war in a very subtle and realistic manner. While it accurately depicts the brutality and inhumanity of that war, it also does something that many films related to this period to not handle as effectively - Cold Mountain studies the southern context from the inside out, and portrays changes among the non-slave owning common people wrought by the war. And, almost uniquely, Cold Mountain does not over-generalize southerners, northerners or anybody else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film surfs through genres as needed - never presenting a dull moment. It is a romance, a war story, an action-adventure and historical fiction, all nicely woven into one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story centers on Inman (Jude Law) and Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman), who are smitten with each other for very simple reasons. As this young romance begins to bud, Inman enlists in the confederate army, taking with him a book Ada has given him and a photograph of her. Ada&#39;s character is one of the most brilliant aspects of the film, which is important because the audience experiences this film from a third person perspective, but the story is clearly hers from the beginning to the end. Ada is an intelligent southern belle and daughter of a liberal minister. She begins the film as a daddy&#39;s girl skilled in many of the arts that southern women who have been surrounded by servants most of their lives were expected to learn. In other words, as she admits to Ruby Thewes (Renee Zellweger), she is a master of everything useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ada&#39;s father passes on, and she is left to manage his modest estate by herself. With no experience of this sort, she struggles, and survives by holding the memory of Inman close to her heart. Ruby enters the picture as a tough young woman who has been raised by a drunk and negligent father. Ruby has all the skills and abilities Ada lacks, and as they become inseparable business partners, they grow to love one another as best friends. Inman&#39;s experience is radically different, but something of a mirror image. During his participation in the war, he sees many friends killed for causes they don&#39;t really believe in, and decides to desert. Nobody he meets comes to his rescue as he begins the thousand mile walk back to Cold Mountain and Ada, and most of those he meets die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bulk of the film takes place during Inman&#39;s long walk, following both of the protagonists as they live, learn, grow and change. An on-going act of will borne of desperation preserves their intense passionate love. For Inman, it is his only source of hope in a world of pure desperation. For Ada, it is very much the same thing, but also a symbol and remnant of the old south - a world which is rapidly passing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cinematography is powerful and breathtaking. There are beautiful shots of Appalachian landscapes which give the film a strong sense of history. The script and editing are also extremely strong - emphasizing the broad class and educational differences reflected in the ante bellum southern dialects of the middle and lower classes. With the cast of this film, nothing short of perfection should be expected. And the cast, mostly, rises to the occasion. My one criticism, however, relates to the accents adopted by Kidman and Law&#39;s characters. An Australian and a Brit probably should not be expected to accurately reproduce southern American speech, but there are a few occasions where these two exceptionally gifted actors produce distracting vocal slips. I admit my oversensitivity to this, and can say with some confidence that it won&#39;t bother most people. Zellweger&#39;s performance is outstanding and she creates a character I will remember into my senescence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very highly recommended.&#34;
b&#34;I&#39;ve Seen The Beginning Of The Muppet Movie, But Just The Half. Because I Only Watched It At Mrs Kelly&#39;s Friend&#39;s House. The Songs Were The Best And The Muppets Were So Hilarious. They Learn That If They Believe In The End Of The Rainbow, Anyone Can Make It, No Matter How Small, No Matter How Green(Which Was Included In The Trailer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kermit Is My Favorite Protagonist(Which Means It Describes The Main Character) And So Are The Other Muppets. Mel Brooks Was Amazing When He Played Professor Max Krassman. The Scene Where Miss Piggy Saves Kermit By Doing Kung Fu On Those Guys. It Was So Cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Muppet Movie Is The Best Jim Henson Film With The Most Hilarious Characters And People Will Cherish For His Successful Film.&#34;
b&#34;First, I&#39;m a huge Buddy Holly fan. I grew up knowing who he was, and I knew all about that fateful plane ride that extinguished three incredibly bright flames just like that. But I had never truly listened to his music. I had heard much of it, yes, but not until I sat down with the intention of getting something out of it did I truly come to see the real Buddy Holly. And let me tell you that my world is a different one now because of him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of this adoration for such an incredible man, I bought The Buddy Holly Story without ever seeing it previously. I&#39;m torn on my views of this film. Perhaps it&#39;s because Buddy feels so alive to me that I just couldn&#39;t bear seeing Gary Busey in this role. I&#39;ll admit that he did a nice job acting, but his singing sounded so forced. It seemed to me as if he knew he didn&#39;t sound a bit like Buddy himself and therefore was using far too much energy to make an attempt at a similar sound. In some parts of the film, he succeeded. But others.. ouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie spanned a period of several years, but I feel that portraying this time span could have been handled much better. I had a difficult time distinguishing at what point in Buddy&#39;s life certain events were happening. I also had a serious problem with some of the historical inaccuracies. I think the worst one was the portrayal of the Crickets. I understand how their real names couldn&#39;t be used, and how for simplification there were only two of them in the movie.. and maybe this was a good thing. Because the film&#39;s background vocals were cringe-worthy, and I disliked the way they were portrayed as a hindrance to Buddy&#39;s career. Something else that really made no difference to the film but irked me was Gary Busey&#39;s teeth. They wore me out! Buddy Holly had much better teeth. I don&#39;t know why I noticed it.. but I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ll end this review on what I felt was the best part of the movie: Buddy&#39;s last performance. His final phone call to Maria, the Big Bopper&#39;s performance, bringing him and Richie Valens to the stage, followed by the still frame ending. It startled even me, and I feel that it effectively shows the audience how at one moment Buddy Holly was so alive and energetic, and that his flame was snuffed out in the blink of an eye. It was a beautiful way to portray this horrible tragedy I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good movie, despite the obvious problems.. 7/10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some obvious flaws, could use some work... but not bad.&#34;
b&#39;I see it when I was 12 year old and I dream to see it again !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What marvelous Sammy Davis Jr singing &#34;it ain\&#39;t necessarily so !&#34;&#39;
b&#39;&#34;on our own&#34; is a touching story of four kids who run away from foster home after their mother dies, with only one suitcase, their dog Ralph and $9 they set off in their mums old car in search of their uncle Jack. On the way their car breaks down and they meet Peggy Williams, a schoolteacher on holidays and she offers to help them out. Together she and the children search for uncle Jack but are forced to hide from the authorities that plan to take them back into foster care as they do so. This film tells a story of love, friendship and how important it is to stick with your family as the children venture out on their amazing journey.&#39;
b&#34;If you want to see a great little horror comedy with an eerie feel to it this is the one. If you are expecting a blood and guts gore flick thats going to scare your pants off- then this isn&#39;t the one for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the budget that this movie was filmed on, the music was particularly amazing! Even though the film was filmed on a bargain budget the music and audio was definitely better than most movies with a huge budget!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story was truly well done and the director is to be commended. There is an almost perfect blend of comedy to horror in this movie! The acting is top notch and leaves room to make a sequel which I am definitely holding out for! I have no doubt that this movie will become an instant cult classic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a nutshell this movie chronicles the life story of a boy who enters into the career of becoming a grave-robber. It tells the story in flashback of each of the more fantastic experiences that the robber duo encounters. Vampires to Zombies and even aliens! Our stars start out as simple grave-robbers stealing for jewellery but quickly become body snatchers for a mad doctor (Angus Scrim) who requires bodies for his medical practise. When the duo find a way to have a vampire dispatch their cruel employer the grave-robbers discover that trafficking in undead corpses is much more profitable than just stealing regular dead bodies. The only problem is that there is another gang called the house of Murphy that is competing for the same undead corpses- and thats where both grave-robbing gangs clash head to head with dire consequences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie is one of the most refreshing and exciting horror comedies that I have seen in years and reminds me of the Evil Dead. Don&#39;t miss this one, you will regret it!&#34;
b&#39;&#34;Nuovomondo&#34; was a great experience. Many filmmakers tell their stories to a big extent via dialogue. Emanuele Crialese directs his film very visually driven. For everything he wants to tell, he finds powerful images that are able to stand for themselves. Thus, he understands film as a medium that primarily tells its stories over the pictures on screen. Particularly European cinema is often very dialogue-driven (and many of the young US-American directors are strongly influenced by that). Crialese\&#39;s opposite attitude was really the point, that made this film special for me. It has also a very interesting topic that is wrapped up in a quite unusual story and told with humour. Vincenzo Amato is outstanding as family head Salvatore, as well as the amazing Charlotte Gainsbourg, who I enjoy watching in every single one of her movies. There are many great sequences in this movie. Just to pick one: When the ship leaves Italy and the people just quietly stare. This scene is great, particularly if you consider the pop cultural references that go with it (Titanic!).&#39;
b&#39;Someone once defined what is the definition of AN INTELLECTUAL as being: &#34;A person who can listen to &#34;The William Tell Overture&#34; without thinking of the LONE RANGER!&#34; In this, we heartily concur! It surely would be a tall order to accomplish this, and one that Leopold Stokowski, Arturo Toscanini or .Leonard Bernstein would all find nigh well impossible to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And in this there is no disgrace. The Radio Series and the Television Series, along with some Movie Serials, Feature Films, Syndicated Newspaper Comic Strip and Comic Books, all did their part to make &#34;the Masked Man of the Plains and his Faithful Indian companion, Tonto&#34; a deeply seeded element of our collective psyche and of our literary folklore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with most legends, it all started gradually, first with a series of Radio Plays, written for local use in Detroit over Radio Station WXYZ. The Creator was one George W. Trendle and the Principal Writer on the Series was Mr. Trendle\&#39;s brother-in-law, Mr. Fran Striker. The year was 1933 when the Ranger first rode out to &#34;\xc2\x85the Plains of the Early Western United States!&#34; The Lone Ranger, Tonto and the Radio Series all successfully guided Depression Era Americans through the mid and late \&#39;30\&#39;s up to and through World War II. But the Post-War Era found the country in the midst of a Super-Nova Explosion of invention and technology. There had been a new communications medium standing ready in the wings, but unable to go forth until both VE Day and VJ Day had been achieved. Once these were accomplished and the World and America was ready to settle down to both Peace and Prosperity. The &#34;New Technology&#34; was, of course was TELEVISION! And we would surely need something else than &#34;Roller Derby&#34; and &#34;Wrestling From Marigold Arena&#34; to fill up the broadcast hours. And while at first, the time that a TV Station had anything on, except that portrait of that Mohican Chief (Test Pattern, Schultz!) Very soon and with post haste, the Networks began tapping their existing Natural Resources, their existing programming! Virtually all would be ripe for adaptation to the TV Screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the folks over at Lone Ranger, Incorporated were very interested when Producers Jack Chertok, Harry Poppe, Sherman Harris and Jack Wrather all approached them with a deal to put The Masked Man and Tonto on the Television waves, as well as the Radio.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Immediately they went to work and gave us the first season, which made use of the considerable back log of Radio Dramas, all potentially adaptable to TV dramas. They cast Clayton Moore, a fine supporting actor in many a feature film, and with about a dozen years experience. He also had done some work in Serials over at Republic Pictures\&#39; &#34;Thrill Factory&#34;, which would be invaluable experience in doing &#34;THE LONE RANGER&#34;. Cast as his &#34;faithful Indian companion&#34; and partner in bringing Justice to various parts of the Frontier, we had sheer perfection in character-supporting Actor, Jay Silverheels.** We must mention that there was that rift in about \&#39;53, when Clayton Moore walked and was replaced with John Hart. After a season or so, Mr. Moore was back in-having been missed so much! Now, Back to Our Story!! The first years of filming gave the episodes a look and a sound all of their own. They made good use of off screen Narrator, which gave these shows a feel of authenticity and an individual, stand-out one of a kind series. The actors employed were all veterans of the movies of the late silent era thru the 1930\&#39;s and 1940\&#39;s. A lot of them had been just about exclusively &#34;Cowboy Movie&#34; players. A good example of these is the casting of Glenn Strange (Bartender Sam on &#34;GUNSMOKE&#34;) as the vicious, murderous Gang Leader, Butch Cavandish. And it was the Cavendish Gang\&#39;s massacre of the Texas Rangers that led to the origin of John Reid (thought to have been slain with the other Texas Rangers) as the &#34;LONE RANGER&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the old timers in the cast, you will find a lot of new and up and coming talent (then) in the cast. We see people like Phyllis Coates, Dwayne Hickman, Denver Pyle and others in the cast from week to week. All of this, along with an always calling for fair-play, justice and peace in a western world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last couple of seasons brought some big changes. First was the use of Colour Filming. That made no difference as a Colour TV Set was still a long way off for our household. The second was a new set of musical themes and queues. (Other than Rossini\&#39;s Finale from &#34;U NO Wutt!&#34;) The new music was never a big deal to us, as we preferred the &#34;old Radio&#34; stock stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this series and two Feature Films done during this period, THE LONE RANGER (Warner Brothers, 1956) and THE LONE RANGER AND THE LOST CITY OF GOLD (United Artists, 1958), the character has been permanently and indelibly impressed in our identity as a People, we Americans!&#39;
b&#34;this movie is simply amazing.. unfortunately in Portugal not even a shadow of him... and i agree with a former opinion, only FF fans will really give the movie the real credit... but for the rest.. i dare you to watch it. the story is great, and i thought that the game has ended the story, but the screenwriters have given us a great story to the god of all r.p.g.&#39;s ... the ost, as usual, it came from heaven ;) ehehe but the little details that they gave us ( us fans of the game) are beautiful .. like the ring tone is the Battle winning song of the game, and even some moves are quite familiar just watch it it&#39;s a great movie great story, great animation... just a 10/10&#34;
b&#39;It was a movie that made ya think a little. Some parts a little cheesy, some parts pretty good. Plot did thicken at times and just when you thought Angella (Sandra) found a friend the friend was fraud or dead. All I got to say is that DENNIS MILLER should have been in the whole movie. His character was the best, very refreshing after all the crap Angella went through. He would have lifted me and Angella through the dumps.&#39;
b&#34;Spirit and Chaos is an artistic biopic of Miyazawa Kenji, a Japanese poet and writer who was active in the early 20th century. The film captures and interprets his artistic method (&#39;sketching&#39; poems), his inspiration (the spirit of nature and its fantastic beauty) and his struggles to accept a harsh reality in the face of his idealist imagination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film integrated excerpts of Miyazawa&#39;s poems into the plot beautifully. His relationships with his students was powerful, especially in one scene where he offers everything he has to a student who has just been caught stealing materials from the classroom. Miyazawa&#39;s selfless compassion for the farmers in his village, his sister and other unfortunate people can serve as a lesson to us all. Furthermore, Miyazawa&#39;s devotion to science was also nicely portrayed. In a time when Western ideas were still met with skepticism, especially in provincial towns like the one where Miyazawa grew up, he understands its usefulness in helping his fellow villagers and is inspired by its elegance. The way the film presented moments of artistic passion and disappointment in the writer were truly intense and well interpreted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt that the CGI integrated into the film, while groundbreaking an innovative, clashed with the more organic animation. It could be argued that this was intentional to represent conflict within the main character, but I found it rather unaesthetic. I also wish that the film had discussed Miyazawa&#39;s Buddhist influence, but it worked fine without it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I though this film was very well done. I give it a 9/10, with the one point being deducted for the CGI. Otherwise the animation, plot and dialog were all wonderful and heartfelt. I haven&#39;t seen any other films by Kawamori Shoji, but after seeing this one I will be sure to give them a chance.&#34;
b&#39;Now this is the sort of film we used to get weekly . Now-a-days it is rare to see a drama that depends on the cast talking to each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are no explosions, car chases or any chases,there are implied sexual situations.This is not film for the younger crowd, It is for those that appreciate people talking to each other,They do argue a lot as we have married couple having mid life problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emily Watson &amp; Tom Wilkinson are seemingly a very happy middle aged loving man &amp; wife. Now living in this same small London suburb, handsome, Rupert Everett returns home to visit his wealthy father.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He of course meets Emily Watson, It would be easy for anyone to be smitten by Emily. I say no more, except that as the credits begin there is a fatal accident,the rest of the film is about the repercussions of this accident &amp; all the lies the various characters tell..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting by this trio &amp; the others is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Julien Fellows wrote the screenplay based on a novel by Nigel Balchin. He also directed, this was his first directorial attempt &amp; he did very well. The entire production is first rate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film had a few month theatrical run in late 2005, is under 80 theatres. This to me is a shame, Stupid comedies open on at least 2000 screens but real good drams as this &amp; many others open in only a few.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way there are some very funny lines regarding certain situations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ratings: ***1/2 (out of 4) 95 points (out of 100) IMDb 9 (out of 10)&#39;
b&#39;My friend made me sit down and watch this film. This is out there material. &#34;God the Devil, Heaven Hell... and a restaurant thrown in for good measure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four guys and a prick. Who dies? When and how?is That\&#39;s the story. You\&#39;ll never guess the ending for this one. A skillfully realized little gem of Aussie cinema. Hats of to the team that made this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10 out of 10.&#39;
b&#34;One of the best films I&#39;ve seen in a long time, precise in its vision, and beautiful and highly imaginative in its realization. I can&#39;t say much without giving it away, and I don&#39;t recommend you actually read that much about this movie before seeing--just see it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But ah, one must come up with ten lines of text to have a review listed on IMDb. Conundrum. What can I do? Tell you about the film? Nope. Can&#39;t do it. I think I enjoyed this movie precisely because saw it with no preconceptions. Please you do the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose this can be said: the acting is excellent and understated, and what I have come to love about foreign movies is that the movies are actually about the MOVIES, not the stars.&#34;
b&#39;Utopia, made in 1950 in France, was the last film Laurel and Hardy produced. With the bad reputation the duo have for their post 1930\&#39;s productions I was expecting this film to be awful. Although admittedly it isn\&#39;t up to the standard of their &#34;vintage&#34; comedies I was pleasantly surprised. It\&#39;s watchable, and in parts genuinely funny! And certainly the plot is of the same standard as you\&#39;d expect. Some gags are derivative from their earlier work, but when you consider this film was their first for five years after their last Hollywood produced film, &#34;The Bullfighters&#34;, the routines are executed confidently as you\&#39;d expect from these professionals. Some scenes are not up to much, but the value of this film is that some scenes are funny, and as such, absolutely priceless. I particularly enjoyed the bedtime scene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt sad at the end of the film. Our heros are left on their own desert island. It\&#39;s such a metaphor for the real life truth. Hollywood and audiences of the time had consigned the stars to a desert island of memories, and that was to become last image they portrayed in film. Ollie died seven years later and Stan died fifteen years later. Stan turned down an offer to appear in &#34;It\&#39;s A Mad Mad Mad Mad World&#34; in 1963. What a shame that was - a colour film, only two years before he passed. However, his health probably wasn\&#39;t up to much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These boys are probably the greatest comedy performers of all time, and although the movie is far from their true potential, it\&#39;s still an honour to watch them appear in film for the last time, and touching on the echos of their towering talent.&#39;
b&#39;What can you possibly say? This is the uncut hardcore, musical Alice! It works too with a large energetic cast seemingly enjoying themselves to the hilt and whilst one could wish for a re-mastered version, I guess we are lucky to even have this video transfer. Pretty much a delight throughout. There are a couple of slightly off moments but this could have been embarrassing all through and it certainly is not. It also could have been and today would have been too camp. No, a very fine effort that is amusing, tuneful and just sexy enough. Fine performances particularly the Kristine DeBell in the lead and was that an unaccredited Richard Prior as the prone Knight being vigorously (if discreetly) ridden?&#39;
b&#39;I enjoyed this movie okay, it just could have been so much better. I was expecting more action than what I got...which was more of a comedy than anything else. Granted, it was serious in parts and it had a good fight scene here and there for the most part it was more romance and comedy with some action and no horror at all. Which is hard to do with a vampire movie. A vampire hunter loses his partner and must train another, his sister is going through a difficult break up, but she is being pursued by a vampire of all things. Granted, this vampire is rather nice and not into sucking blood. So that is all there is really to it except for a plot of another vampire after certain royal vampires so he can gain ultimate power. Some of the problems with this movie is that its plot went here and there and the movie had a very uneven flow to it, that and it seemed to shift genres a bit much too. One minute action, the next pure comedy. However, the girls were cute, there is good action, the comedy was worthy of a chuckle or two and Jackie Chan makes a rather energetic appearance or two. This movie probably just needed more development in some areas such as the villain who is basically not really explored at all. So for a movie with a few good fights and a chuckle or two this is rather good...though why was it rated R? I have seen stuff we have made that is PG-13 that is a lot worse than this.&#39;
b&#34;Heard about this film a long while ago and finally found it on ebay for five bucks. I wasn&#39;t expecting much but wow, was I ever surprised. It&#39;s a story of a boy and girl in love trying to escape an evil king who wants the girl for himself and takes place in a huge castle, reminds me of ICO for PS2 because some shots gave you a sense of vertigo.Sounds pretty standard but this movie is insane! It&#39;s hard to believe such an original animated feature was made in 1952. Also, the king was probably one of the creepiest character&#39;s I&#39;ve seen in a long time, with a feminine walk, weird eyes (usually crossed), and a soft but scary voice. The only problem I had with the film was that the boy and girl had no personality and hardly even any lines except for calling for mr. wonderbird (A large talking green bird)to save them. The animation was fantastic in most areas but some cells were missing from some scenes which sucked. It&#39;s incredibly original with flying police and giant mechs and even laugh out loud funny at times, it&#39;s a real shame this is such an obscure title because it&#39;s really a good film. Check it out sometime.&#34;
b&#34;This Showtime cable film features a talented cast and weaves together several storylines involving the darker side of New York... from the naive and innocent tourists&#39; nightmarish adventure to a pair of undercover cops on the streets... to an old friend&#39;s betrayal, it has it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well worth a look, as is its sequel.&#34;
b&#39;The year 1983 saw a strange phenomenon; two rival Bond films. &#34;Octopussy&#34;, starring Roger Moore, was part of the official Cubby Broccoli Bond franchise. &#34;Never Say Never Again&#34;, made by a rival producer, is, apart from the awful &#34;Casino Royale&#34;, the only Bond movie which does not form part of that franchise. Its big attraction was that it brought back the original Bond, Sean Connery; its title reputedly derived from Connery\&#39;s remark after &#34;Diamonds Are Forever&#34; that he would never again play the role. Some have complained that Connery was, at 53, too old for the role, but he was in fact three years younger than his successor Moore, who not only made &#34;Octopussy&#34; in the same year but went on to make one further Bond film, &#34;A View to a Kill&#34;, two years later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film owes its existence to the settlement of a lawsuit about the film rights to Ian Fleming\&#39;s work. It is perhaps unfortunate that the terms of the settlement included a clause that the new film had to be a remake of &#34;Thunderball&#34;, as that was perhaps not the greatest of the Connery Bonds. (A remake of &#34;Dr No&#34; or &#34;Goldfinger&#34; might have worked better). The plot is much the same as that of the earlier film; the terrorist organisation SPECTRE, acting together with a megalomaniac tycoon named Largo, have stolen two American nuclear warheads and are attempting to hold the world\&#39;s governments to ransom by threatening to detonate them unless they receive a vast sum of money. It falls to Bond, of course, to save the world by tracking down the missing missiles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film is fortunate in that it has not just one but two of the most beautiful Bond girls of all, Barbara Carrera as the seductive but lethal Fatima Blush and Kim Basinger as Largo\&#39;s girlfriend Domino who defects to Bond\&#39;s side after learning of her lover\&#39;s evil plans. A number of the Bond films have a plot that hangs upon the hero\&#39;s ability to win over the villain\&#39;s mistress or female accomplice- there are similar developments, for example, in &#34;Goldfinger&#34;, &#34;Live and Let Die&#34; and &#34;The Living Daylights&#34;. In the official series, Bond\&#39;s ally is normally regarded as the female lead, but here Carrera, playing the villainess, is billed above Basinger, who was a relatively unknown actress at the time. Basinger, of course, has gone on to become one of Hollywood\&#39;s biggest stars, whereas Carrera is one of a number of Bond girls who have somewhat faded from view.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of the villains, Max von Sydow makes an effective Blofeld, the head of SPECTRE, but Klaus Maria Brandauer seemed too bland and nonthreatening as Largo, except perhaps during the &#34;Domination&#34; game, a more sophisticated variant on those violent computer games such as &#34;Space Invaders&#34; that were so popular in the early eighties. Brandauer can be an excellent actor in his native German, in films such as &#34;Mephisto&#34; and &#34;Oberst Redl&#34;, but he does not comes across so expressively in English.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the film\&#39;s features is that it both follows the normal Bond formula and, at times, departs from it. There is the standard world-in-peril plot, chase sequences, a series of exotic locations, glamorous women, sinister villains and a specially written theme song based on the film\&#39;s title. There is, however, no extended pre-credits sequence, and we see some familiar characters in a new light. For example, Bond\&#39;s boss M becomes a languid, supercilious aristocrat, his American colleague Felix Leiter is shown as black for the only time, and the scientist Q is portrayed by Alec McCowen as a disillusioned cynic with (despite his characteristically upper-class Christian name of Algernon) a distinctly working-class accent. There is also an amusing cameo from Rowan Atkinson as a bumbling British diplomat. Although Connery was perhaps not quite a good here as he was in some of his earlier films in the role, this ringing the changes on the familiar theme makes this one of the more memorable Bonds. 7/10 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A goof. Rowan Atkinson\&#39;s character states that he is from the British Embassy in Nassau. As, however, the Bahamas is a Commonwealth country, Britain would have a High Commission in its capital, not an Embassy.&#39;
b&#34;I have to confess I fell into the cynical trap of believing that Australians couldn&#39;t make drama unless it meant a lot of crying, and I am an Australian. Sad, isn&#39;t it? While this movie does involve crying, its not dramatic crying, its honest emotion shining through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this film is a whodunnit. I knew what the final outcome was going to be when I started watching this, so I tried to guess who it was that was going to do it. I missed by a mile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was stunned when I found out the director, Murali Thulluri was only around 21 when he made this film. I would love to shake his hand. He knows how to make a movie. I hope he has more coming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the characters we meet before the main title credit (about 12 minutes in) is an anti hero. All of them troubled in their own way and all of them as selfish as the next one. Even when they are sympathetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The saddest scene in the movie, and there are some that are difficult to watch) is the final scene where We&#39;re formally introduced to the real main character and we&#39;re told of their nephew. That scene made me cry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My faith in Australian drama has been restored. We&#39;re masters at comedy, but I was getting bored with comedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Murali, if you happen to check this out, you touched my soul and for that I can only thank you.&#34;
b&#39;Perhaps the deepest cartoon made in the USA, &#34;Duckman&#34; runs short at 70 episodes in four seasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike the often innocuous criticism found in &#34;The Simpsons&#34; (a pretty good show in its own right), and the rude-for-rudeness-sake humour in &#34;South Park,&#34; every bit of this series follows a plan. The criticism of US society, from its mercantilism to its selfishness, carries much more bite than it does in any other animated series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cultural references in &#34;Duckman&#34; also tend to be obscure sometimes (anyone browsing the fan sites will realize most have not even been caught). In that, it is different from &#34;The Simpsons,&#34; which usually uses pop culture instead of the high-brow stuff often hidden in &#34;Duckman.&#34; As other people writing about it notice, there is a growth in the characters (Bernice, Duckman and Cornfed). Also, by making the main character not just an offensive neurotic but in fact someone who is living a personal tragedy (as is made clear in episodes like &#34;The Once and Future Duck&#34; (\&#39;You\&#39;ll love her until the end of your days...\&#39;) and in &#34;Bev Takes a Holiday&#34; (when he takes a chance to tell Beverly all those things he couldn\&#39;t tell Beatrice), the series is anchored in a deep sense of reality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One can\&#39;t avoid feeling sorry for him and his lucid madness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, in my opinion, the best cartoon ever made in the USA and one of the best series ever. I doubt it will ever be on DVD though. Far too many things the Duck said make much more sense today.&#39;
b&#39;Back in August, \&#39;81 there was a country-ish buzz to movies, big hits like &#34;Urban Cowboy&#34;, &#34;Every Which Way But Loose&#34;, &#34;Smokey and the Bandit&#34; were all the rage. For that reason I suspect the producers of this movie chose &#34;Honky Tonk Freeway&#34; as the title hoping it would help the movie\&#39;s box office receipts by drawing in that same &#34;Urban Cowboy&#34; crowd. Instead &#34;Honky Tonk Freeway&#34; bombed at the theaters and I suspect it do so in part by being burdened with a poorly chosen title. Thats same problem burdens it now on video and thats too bad because its a pretty good movie and in a comedy style ahead of it\&#39;s time. No matter what, probably anybody who can remember 1981 will enjoy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its too bad this movie bombed. But I think it would have anyway even if it hadn\&#39;t been saddled with a poor title. Its a movie ahead of its time. One could look at this movie now and see that its clearly a father or *great-uncle anyway) to the kinds of comedy made today. For its day &#34;Honky Tonk Freeway&#34; was pretty full of innuendo and a kind of frankness about life that didn\&#39;t get popular in comedy till much later on. While clearly its a child of &#34;Airplane&#34;, its more mature, and while its certainly no &#34;Knocked Up&#34; it clearly points in that direction. The characters are more &#34;comedy-mature&#34; in that they are low-key and don\&#39;t ever think anything they do is anything other than serious. The jokes are in the choices of what to emphasize and the camera views and the way the view themselves and their situations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, more than that, &#34;Honky Tonk Freeway&#34; is a real time capsule. A great look back at the exceedingly early 80\&#39;s. The people in this movie are dressed and act as everyday people of 1981 did. It was clearly meant to reflect the times and be a sly comedic comment on everyday life around them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don\&#39;t know if my review is helping you, but this is really a good, sometimes kind of excellent, movie thats worth renting if you want to see how a lot of faces that are familiar today looked when they were 30 years younger. Beverly D\&#39;Angelo is so young its hard to realize its her sometimes. So are Beau Bridges and Terri Garr. Terry Garr was just about to become the toast of Hollywood as her next movie after this one was &#34;Tootsie&#34; which finally made her a star. Howard Hessmann was arguably the biggest &#34;current&#34; star of the the day when this movie was made. Back in 1981 Howard Hessmann was the star of the big hit TV show &#34;WKRP in Cinncinatti&#34;. He played its lead character, the rascally night DJ. Daniel Stern was just about to break out as a star as the grown-up narrator voice of the lead child character in the popular 80\&#39;s sitcom &#34;The Wonder Years&#34; There are also several faces that are no longer with us these days, its nice to see Hume Crowyn and Jessica Tandy as a an old married couple on a journey. Jessica Tandy would finally pick up her Oscar ten years after this for &#34;Driving Miss Daisy&#34;. There is also the great Geraldine Page in one of her final movie appearances. Though she\&#39;d had a brilliant career she didn\&#39;t get her Oscar till four years after this in 1985\&#39;s &#34;Trip to Bountiful&#34;, for which she richly deserved it, and she died very soon after getting that award.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, there are lots of other faces in this movie, actors who aren\&#39;t big stars but who have done tons of supporting work. Many are familiar even if you can\&#39;t think of their name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie is a pleasant little diversion. A bunch of people with a variety of problems set out from various locations each for their own individual unrelated reasons who all, in a vaguely Altman-esk way, end up heading towards Florida and unbeknownst to them a rendevoux in the little town of Ticlaw, Florida, which happens to be reeling from the effects of being bypassed by the recently constructed interstate nearby which did not construct an exit to Ticlaw which effectively takes the town off the map.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And thats also what this movie is about, fascination with the whole idea of the interstate system, which had only recently been &#34;completed&#34;. It had taken a generation to build, from when it was authorized by congress around 1960, through many years as different parts were built and then &#34;went live&#34; and by 1980 most of the system had finally been built and all connected together and first the first time the promise of what the interstate system would be had turned into what is. And people were enchanted by it. Everybody by 1980 was pretty much an &#34;interstate freeway veteran&#34; in the sense that by then everybody had used parts of it and knew how it worked and how it was different from other roads in that it had no red lights or stop signs, only on and off ramps, and that it went to places that were formerly less accessible. By 1980 anyone could drive anywhere in comfort and without having to stop for anything except to eat and sleep and a bathroom. And this was all new then. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ending is anti-climatic and isn\&#39;t that satisfying albeit its one spectacular moment. What makes it great is it\&#39;s the journey not the destination that makes Honky Tonk Freeway timeless in spite of it being such a product of its day. Forget its title; instead let it take you down memory lane.&#39;
b&#39;A pity, nobody seems to know this little thriller-masterpiece. Where bigger budgeted movies fail, &#34;Terminal Choice&#34; delivers lots of thrills, shocks and bloody violence. A little seen gem, that deserves being searched for in your local video shop. That anonymous guy beneath is quite right, when he says, you\&#39;ll never trust hospitals again... it IS that effective ! Good ending,too, not really a twist, but it doesn\&#39;t end the way one thought it would. Yep, that\&#39;s Ellen Barkin in an early role...&#39;
b&#39;I have to admit, before i watched this film i thought, this is one of those soppy love stories where everything works out fine and dandy all the way through. but i was proved wrong when i actually sat down to watch this. I found that it was in fact a really good story about a family who go to a dance park for a 3 week holiday and there the youngest daughter, baby, finds love but has difficulty getting there with her new found love due to disagreements with her father. But along the way helps another dance instructor, and risks the whole relationship...A truly heartwarming film, like no other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/10&#39;
b&#34;The play is cleverly constructed - begin with the porter, Rainbow - &amp; let the audience see the background unfold through his eyes. The film follows the play with great faithfulness, working, no doubt, on the simple premise that it couldn&#39;t be bettered. Now throw in a host of superb character actors - &amp; the result is a resounding triumph.A definite must-see.&#34;
b&#34;It is to typical of people complaining about something when they no nothing about it...So this is about a gay man falling for a straight women. First of all...This is a true story so you cant say its not believable Second its written by a gay man so the whole thing about this being against the gays are just plain stupid. Personally I think this was the best love story I&#39;ve ever seen. And I am very pro gay. I think this shows that real love is about personality not just looks and sex. And it has nothing against anyone who is gay, straight or bi unlike so many other shows. Maybe we in Europe take to it more cus most TV here are a bit deeper and make you think more then American TV...Plus we don&#39;t fear when it comes to showing certain things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want something funny with one of Englands best (Lesley Sharp) and you want to see a decent believable love story without too much sap this is for you. I know I love it&#34;
b&#34;The story in this movie is fairly implausible B grade stuff, but the script called for a creepy guy to play the lead, and in 1940, that meant Peter Lorre. And Peter is at his creepiest in this one as island owner Stephen Danel, who gets prisoners paroled to his custody to work at his island diamond mine. Upon arrival the parolees discover that they are slave mine workers that can be beaten or killed at the whim of Danel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only two things seem to have it worse off than the slaves; Danel&#39;s wife, and monkeys. Monkeys tick him off so much that his violence towards them probably leads to the only meat the slaves get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lorre is perfect in his role here, and creeps up the screen in industrial-strength fashion. Although the script is not Casablanca caliber, the editing is very tight and there are no wasted scenes. This is a very watchable story, but I&#39;m not sure what niche this movie filled. Too long for a short subject, and too short for a feature length film, I&#39;m not sure how this was marketed to theaters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just caught this for the first time on a late night/early morning TCM showing. Lorre fans will not want to miss this one if they haven&#39;t seen it.&#34;
b&#39;&#34;The Devil in the Dark&#34; is William Shatner\&#39;s favorite episode. It is also one of my favorite episodes. The program is pure Star Trek because it deals with one of the series\&#39; main themes: the respect for other life forms. I do not think one could get a clearer example of one of the show\&#39;s most interesting ideas. In this episode, Kirk and his crew have to confront a monster that is killing miners on a distant planet. The story is an excuse to explore the right that humans have to destroy creatures that are a vital part of the environment. Today\&#39;s concerns with environmental causes make the show more relevant now than ever before. It is extremely well written and performed with gusto by our beloved cast. One memorable sequence involves Spock joining with the mind of the monster. Plenty of tension between Spock and Kirk (they want to solve the problem using different methods) adds to the fun. Shatner and Leonard Nimoy do some of their best work here.&#39;
b&#34;Ever since 1981, Nintendo has been making great video games such as Super Mario and Zelda. Most ideas would get a bit boring after 20 years. Games made by Nintendo never seem to get boring because they&#39;re always adding something new. It went from arcade games to the Wii and I hear that there&#39;s a new version of the Wii scheduled for release in 2011. The thing that makes Wii games so different is the fact that your actually doing something instead of just sitting on the couch pushing buttons. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I have more good news. Super Mario Galaxy 2 is to be released in 2010.&#34;
b&#34;The movie is a really well made one, which is great and looking and passionately directed. You can tell that every shot is thought over and executed to perfection. For the lovers of cinema this is especially a great watch and they especially should be able to appreciate the beauty of it and the passion for cinema that is being put into it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s hard to place this movie under one label. It&#39;s not really a drama, it&#39;s not really a thriller and it&#39;s not really a comedy. Instead its more a movie with its own style, that does things its own way. It doesn&#39;t necessarily follow the rules of cinema and features many different elements from many different genres combined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But just like the movie its main character, the movie gets sort of slow and boring in parts. The artistic style of directing tries to conceal that the story is actually a quite simple one and it&#39;s more as if the movie relied solely on its style and overall atmosphere created by the movie. It doesn&#39;t make the movie horrible or anything but it just prevents it from being a true absolute must-see. In parts the movie also feels as if it&#39;s trying to be too poetic and tries to let the images speak too much for itself. It just feels a bit overdone in parts, though for most part of the movie it still works out beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It features some great camera-work and some unique storytelling, which makes this an original as well as a great film to watch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7/10&#34;
b&#39;Its my favourite film because there\&#39;s so much going on that you don\&#39;t see at first and so many things that make you wonder &#34;Did Kieslowski mean that or is it in my head?&#34; For instance - is the judge meant to be God or some supreme being ?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also Irene Jacob as in The Double Life Of Veronique is outstanding, there may be a few superficially prettier actresses but none who manage to convey beauty of spirit with physical beauty the way she does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tritingnant also is magnificent without really saying much and the things he does say are excellent such as his answer to Valentine . . . &#34;Be&#34;.&#39;
b&#39;I know that to include everything in the book, the film would have to have been several hours long, so I think they did their best to include things that were crucial and pivotal to the story. I thought the casting was great, the children who played Amir and Hassan were very good actors. And the guy who played Amir as an adult was great! The scenes between him and Baba were especially touching. I thought the locations they used were interesting... scenes set in Afghanistan were shot in China, and one scene that took place in Fremont, CA (the graduation scene) was actually shot on Treasure Island in San Francisco. I worked one day as an extra on &#34;Kite Runner&#34; and it was that day, the day they shot the graduation scene. We reported to Treasure Island in the morning, they checked everyone\&#39;s wardrobe to make sure it looked like the late 80s, an then we took our places in the audience. They shot the scene over and over again until they were happy with it. It was cool to see the actors up close and also to see the book\&#39;s author, who was on hand as a story consultant. I thought this book was excellent and I recommend both the book and the movie to anyone. This is a moving story about friendship, love, guilt and eventual redemption. &#34;There is a way to be good again.&#34;&#39;
b&#34;I give this a 10 out of 10, not because the plot was hard to uncover because it wasn&#39;t... but because it leaves one caring for the characters. The acting, by all the cast, is superb, especially Joan Hickson, and it&#39;s a marvellous episode because of it&#39;s heart. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miss Marple is called upon by Jason Rafiel&#39;s dying request to investigate, and solve, a murder that happened some seven or eight years previously, and she has to discover who, why and when as she goes along. Mr Rafiel is the same Rafiel as was in A Caribbean Mystery and so there is a sense of a connection here. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nemesis is definitely one for the amateur psychologists among us, and if you are one of those who is only happy with lots of blood, guts and rip-roaring action sequences, then you won&#39;t like it. But if you are like me, one who loves knowing about PEOPLE and discovering what makes them tick, then Nemesis is the one for you.&#34;
b&#39;This is a fun movie with subtle intention. Its off-beat comedy is hilarious to me, unfunny to my friends. The soundtrack is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I own this on VHS and I have watched it many, many times, because it\&#39;s simply a fun and funny love story with great performances by all the principals (though using Joan Cusack solely as a perch for big hair was a waste of her talent. I know, I know, she was still young...).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a sad note, I decided to check out the DVD last night (instead of watching my VHS tape), and was SHOCKED to find many crucial scenes cut. And on the copy I watched, there was no special feature of deleted scenes: it was as if the deleted scenes never existed!! I am so glad I bought the used VHS at a flea market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is clear there was a great deal of choreography in this, which is another reason I love it so much. It takes great skill, talent, and genius to move around the scenes like Mercedes Ruehl, Dean Stockwell, and Matthew Modine do from scene to scene (Note the scene when the grocery carts converge, the rolling on the floor during the shoot-out in Miami, the Chicken Lickin\&#39; debacle, the foot massage, the salon hair-washing.) There is a very &#34;theatrical&#34; feel to this film, which may be the turn-off for so many whose poor reviews follow: I know some viewers who don\&#39;t quite understand this style mistake the exaggerations and over-the-top performances for poor acting and worse direction. Not so. Jonathan Demme does a great job bringing to life the entire company and their respective roles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The opening credits and first scene rank among my all-time favorites, as well (another favorite opening credits/first scene: Fly Away Home).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad Matthew Modine so ardently skipped out of the public eye; I really like him, and found his casting PERFECT in the role of Mike Smith. Actually, this film is well-cast from soup to nuts: everyone is believable and true to his role. As for the question of expecting audience to accept Pfeiffer and Stockwell as Italians - why not? I thought they pulled it off perfectly well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charming, fun, exciting... what is there not to like? If you want a little fun, watch this quirky, colorful adventure-mob-love story. If you are looking to learn more about organized crime and families, tune to HBO\&#39;s The Sopranos.&#39;
b&#34;This movie is a great film. The movie shows so many themes all in one amazing film. Driving Lessons centers around Ben (Rupert Grint) a shy 17 year old who is coming of age. The movie goes on about how Ben is sick of his dominating mother and how he just wants to be himself. Ben then meets Evie, who he makes a very special bond with. The two take a journey and in the process Ben finds himself and what a relationship that he and Evie share. This is the movie that you watch by yourself, or with someone else. No matter what, you will all feel what Ben goes through in the movie. It is a very heart warming film that just makes you think whether your driving lessons were ever as emotional or as much of a journey as Ben&#39;s Lessons.&#34;
b&#39;Crack House (1989) was one of the few film during the 80\&#39;s that falls into this genre. What\&#39;s supposed to be an anti-drug film turns out to be nothing more than some white-exploitation exercise in depravity. There\&#39;s nothing wrong with that however. The video presentation even has an anti-drug message from one of the stars of the show Richard &#34;turncoat&#34; Roundtree,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie follows two young lovers in high school. One of them is a quasi tough guy and the other is his girl. One of them get\&#39;s turned out by a mutual friend whilst the other is given a trip to the slam and is later on given a chance to get back at his ex-friends. Jim Brown appears as the movie\&#39;s &#34;Mister Big&#34;, he\&#39;s one bad dude who still can punk-out anybody and is a very sadistic guy who likes to smack his hoes and beat the tar out of those who try to defy his word. Luke from General Hospital makes a guest star spot as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like hard edge sleaze then this movie\&#39;s for you. Sadly, Hollywood doesn\&#39;t make these any more and when they do, it\&#39;s neither exploitative nor entertaining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for sleaze fans.&#39;
b&#39;I get the feeling that Lisa Krueger is easy to overlook. I personally found her first film, 1996\&#39;s Manny and Lo, to be a wonderfully detailed character study and the performances were uniformly wonderful(with special credit to Mary Kay Place). The film played for a week or two in major urban centers and vanished. One or two critics really liked it, but many viewed it as slight. Krueger\&#39;s second film, Committed, was released this year (2000) (after nearly two years of delays) and it similarly vanished. And once again critics dismissed the film as slight and pushed the film aside, at most praising Heather Graham\&#39;s screen presence, but rarely her acting ability. And once again, for me, Committed is a solid success. I feel as if Krueger has a genuine voice and a personal visual style and these are traits that shouldn\&#39;t be so easily ignored, simply because she works on a very restrained canvass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The title has several meanings, but mostly it refers to Joline (Graham)\&#39;s refusal to let her husband Carl (Luke Wilson) flake out and leave her. She follows him from New York to El Paso and becomes one of the most appealing stalkers in recent cinematic history. Her respect for her marriage vows leads her to Mexican mysticism and self-discovery. And yep, the plot is just that simple and thus, just that easy to ignore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joline, of course, is the crying voice of a generation whose parents divorced at a rate nearing fifty percent. And for me, her personal revolution against broken promises and a legacy of deceit is fairly intelligent and powerful. Confident in the belief that people just don\&#39;t have enough faith in each other, Joline inevitably has to discover that her beliefs aren\&#39;t in synche with those of society at large. Several comments her have referred to her character as one-dimensional and I\&#39;m afraid that that\&#39;s a simplistic reading of the film. Or perhaps even a misreading. If Joline were just an innocent, she wouldn\&#39;t be interesting at all. It\&#39;s the fact that she understands the world and refuses to play by the rules of the &#34;normals&#34; that makes her so interesting. Sociologically, she\&#39;s a complete deviant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Krueger sometimes falls into moments of cutesy dialogue and her direction of this film has a rather odd over-reliance on shots of clouds moving across the El Paso skyline. However, her mistakes are fairly rare and in this film, as in Manny and Lo, it\&#39;s the performances that carry the day. Graham has never been better because she\&#39;s never had a character as perfectly tailored to her as Joline. For the first time in her career, Graham seems comfortable playing an adult, even one in slightly arrested development. She carries the film perfectly. Luke Wilson and Casey Affleck (as Joline\&#39;s brother) both have a number of fine moments, as do Alfonso Arau, as a Mexican Mystic and Mark Ruffalo and T-Bo, the slightly psychotic truck driver. As in Manny and Lo, the characters are part of their environments, well detailed totally organic creations. These characters may sometimes seem pointlessly quirky, but they make sense in their context. Even Goran Visnjic, as an artist turned on by Joline\&#39;s devotion, fits in in some strange way, even though his character\&#39;s foreigness is never discussed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, this is a movie that gains depth looking back. Another commenter here spoke of the stereotypical Mexican portrayals. And again I\&#39;m tempted to call that a misreading. Joline is looking for self-justification. She knows that her commitment is out of control, but she\&#39;s looking for any spiritual avenue that can help her make sense of herself. Arau\&#39;s character understands that most people don\&#39;t believe in him and he plays up his own faith when he sees a woman who respects him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I can understand how this movie could be viewed as underwhelming, I\&#39;d simply disagree. It\&#39;s consistently funny, frequently hilarious, and all of the characters exude a warmth which is quite wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\&#39;m giving this one a 7.5/10 and when I log in the vote here, that\&#39;ll go up to an 8.&#39;
b&#34;When I was younger, and today, Mr. Bean is a work of genius. Three-time BAFTA nominated Rowan Atkinson stars as the almost silent (miming) human looking alien dropped onto Earth causing chaos and mischief wherever he goes. He has tried to do an exam, put his pants on in front of blind man (he didn&#39;t know he was blind), gone to church, tried to dive at a swimming pool, made lunch on a park bench, seen a scary movie, changed in his car, had a picnic with a fly intruding, spent Christmas with his girlfriend (Matilda Ziegler), looked after a baby in Portsmouth, been to Room 426 of The Queens Hotel in Portsmouth, won a pet contest with his Teddy, driven on top of his Mini on a new chair, and even met and knocked out the Queen. Guests included Rudolph Walker, Richard Briers, Angus Deayton, Nick Hancock from They Think It&#39;s All Over, Caroline Quentin, The Day Today&#39;s David Schneider, Richard Wilson, The Fast Show&#39;s Eryl Maynard and The Vicar of Dibley&#39;s Roger Lloyd-Pack. It was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Comedy (Programme or Series) and Best Light Entertainment Programme. Rowan Atkinson was number 18 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, he was number 24 on The Comedians&#39; Comedian, and he was number 8 on Britain&#39;s Favourite Comedian. Outstanding!&#34;
b&#39;Some films are designed to just entertain you, others to make you laugh, or cry, or uplift, others, like this, aim to provoke, to make you think, and to make you angry. I was angry during this film, not at the film, but at the fact that it was true, that America, the free, does torture in the illogical view that it is doing it for the greater good. The torture scenes in this movie were harrowing, the indifference of people was shattering, the film was compelling in its argument, and showed just how wrong it is to torture people. Of course now that makes me a &#34;bleeding liberal&#34; labels shoved on people by others who shut their minds to the facts that this does happen and should not. People who don\&#39;t realise that as the movie said, for every person tortured,you get ten or one hundred people rise up to perform acts of vengeance. You get an ever increasing cycle of violence. This film did not make me hate America, although I can see how it could do, but it made me hate the way that America has reacted in its post 9/11 world. There is a significant quote in the film, just after we have learned that 19 people have died and seventy five were injured in the bomb scene, the quote is &#34;one American is dead&#34; - that makes the difference. You cannot kill an American, America can kill thousands but you cannot kill a single American, or they will do whatever it takes, including torture to enact justice. This is the American way apparently. Call me a liberal, call me naive (although I think the people who think torture is fine are naive) call me deluded, call me anything you like, but this film is a brilliant example of what is wrong in America and the west today. I wish this film would be shown to all school students, at a minimum. This film will stay with me a long time, part of me wishes I could forget it, because I wish this type of thing never happened, but I know it does, the other part of me wishes I would never forget, because we need to remember these shameful events to prevent them from happening again. Whatever happens to me, this film will be with me for a long time, and I will be telling everyone I know to watch it, not to be entertained, but to be provoked, because sometimes we all need to be provoked.&#39;
b&#34;I saw this film purely by chance. It was shown very late, or more correctly very early one morning on television. I had woken up and was having trouble getting to sleep and this film came on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It deals with a subject covered many times elsewhere (it certainly isn&#39;t as good as Educating Rita, despite a couple of additional twists) and has a very predictable ending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite its very obvious shortcomings I did enjoy the film and this was thanks to the acting of some of its players rather than the story or the piece as a whole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a big fan of Sam Neil and have seen him in many different films including: Dead Calm; The Piano; Sirens; Children of the Revolution; Event Horizon; Bicentennial Man and the ubiquitous Jurassic Park. He was very good but he could have played this part with his eyes shut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the acting was, in my opinion, dreadful Rose Byrne for example and some of the elusions were rather heavy handed (all the board woman in empty lives all dressed totally in white for example).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, two actors (who I hadn&#39;t, or don&#39;t remember, seen before) impressed me a lot Sin\xc3\xa9ad Cusackn as Frances (Frank) Kennedy, and especially Matthew Newton as her son David. He, in particular, was very convincing and I would like to see a lot more of him.&#34;
b&#34;What can I say? I got up this morning and turned on sci-fi and watched half of the first season and figured it all out. Strange, unusual, and brilliant. It gives all potential, and to think at first I said this looks stupid. This has got to be the next best thing since X-Files, but as always nothing will ever take down that show in my opinion. I am telling you, it&#39;s scary and then suspenseful and then mellow. Towards the end you have Miles as a love puppy with a weird pet that is a new species. You have two people on the run from authorities. And a killer tsunami about to strike! Wow! And did I mention Miles pet is a potential killer(well the rest of his species is). Surface is a brilliant show with spins and twists that delivers it all.&#34;
b&#39;Mary Pickford plays Annie Rooney--the daughter of a cop that lives in the tough part of town. She is a rough and tumble young lady of indeterminate age (somewhere between 12 and 16) who loves to scrap but down deep has a heart of gold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very typical style of film for Mary Pickford. Like so many of her films, she plays a young girl--even though she was nearly 40 when she made LITTLE ANNIE ROONEY. And, like so many other stories, she was both plucky and courageous. As a result, I had a strong feeling of d\xc3\xa9j\xc3\xa0 vu. Now if you haven\&#39;t seen her other films, this isn\&#39;t an issue. However, she is essentially playing a character much like the one in SPARROWS or DADDY LONG LEGS--though these two other films are a lot better. Now this isn\&#39;t to say this is a bad film--just that it\&#39;s certainly not among her best work--mostly due to a rather &#34;schmaltzy&#34; story that is very heavy on sentiment but not especially convincing. Entertaining but not essential viewing unless you are a huge fan of the silents.&#39;
b&#39;Great show! About time a reality TV show comes along that closes generation gaps. Contestants range in ages, some seem old enough to have watched the movie when it first came out. And others, looked so young that perhaps parents or teachers handed down the movie hoping it would touch their lives the way it once touch them. Grease has truly become an American icon. Grease is a fun and entertaining movie in which the young and old can relate to. &#34;You\&#39;re The One That We Want&#34; is sure to gain even more Grease followers. The only thing I wish there had been more of is character history, then again it is kind of nice to leave some of it to the nostalgic imagination of the 50\&#39;s. Cant wait to watch the next show...and then on Broadway!!!&#39;
b&#39;Robert Jordan is a television star. Robert Jordan likes things orderly, on time and properly executed. In his world children are to be seen, not heard. So why would Mr. Jordan want to become the master of a rambunctious band of Boy Scouts? Ratings. His staff figures that if learns how to interact with the youth, they will be more inclined to watch his show. Of course watching Jordan cope comprises most of the fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like Mr. Belvedere and Mr. Belvedere Goes to College this one is sure to please.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ANYONE INTERESTED IN OBTAINING A COPY OF THIS FILM PLEASE WRITE TO ME AT: IAMASEAL2@YAHOO.COM&#39;
b&#34;I own this movie on DVD and I have watched it about 10 times and it&#39;s still funny. The jokes will never get boring and I often burst out laughing at inappropriate times just thinking about them. The premise is that Richard and Eddie of Bottom fame own the cheapest hotel in Britain next to a nuclear power plant. They are desperately in need of cash and when a film star in hiding comes to stay their luck just might be in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To watch this movie and not become utterly bored or disgusted you first need to like the humour. Some would say that only hardcore fans really enjoy watching it. But overall it&#39;s a great movie.&#34;
b&#39;The stuff dreams are made of. A complete retelling of the play as a dream of vengeance: will baffle purists, but will delight the open-minded. A superb effort: great cinematography, acting, and script. 11-stars...***********&#39;
b&#34;I sell the dead revolves around convicted grave robber Arthur Blake. Blake&#39;s friend and fellow grave robber Willie Grimes has just been executed and Blake is going to follow suit the next morning. While he sits in his cell awaiting his execution a priest named Father Duffy comes in and asks him if he will tell all he has seen as a grave robber. He then proceeds to give Father Duffy a quasi biography of his more interesting exploits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot pretty much consists of several incidents only tied together by chronology. This prevents the viewer from ever getting bored but it also makes the events less significant as you could easily add or remove a lot of scenes without noticing it much. Though flawed, I thought overall this method added to the fun loving nature of the film and kept it very entertaining. Most of the various stories are good, specifically the alien, the Murphy&#39;s and the vampire, but others weren&#39;t so great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting isn&#39;t amazing but I didn&#39;t find it bad at any point. Dominic Monaghan had a good performance as he managed to be serious when it mattered and also play very well into the comedic parts of the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The characters were not extremely in-depth, but they were all interesting. I also enjoyed how a number of the villains were done in a over-the-top almost comic book manner. The part with the back story of the Murphy&#39;s and their gang is priceless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall, I Sell the Dead very successfully combines horror, comedy and sci-fi into a mish mash of fun and excitement. It is one of the more interesting and original movies I have seen in a while, and it&#39;s unfortunate that independent films like this don&#39;t get more recognition.&#34;
b&#39;During WW2 in the Philipines, Japanese soldiers are starving, dying, growing weak, and becoming more and more insane. A small group of soldiers, trying to stay alive, have eventually resorted to cannibalism. This film perfectly portrays the insanity that overtakes people under extreme conditions. There are a few humorous parts in this movie, but the majority of it is just a very slow moving and realistic film. It follows these soldiers from one painful moment to another, and eventually to death. A very interesting film, showing the death, and the horror, of what may have been the worst war the world has ever seen.&#39;
b&#34;STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One time heroin addict Frankie Machine (Frank Sinatra) gets out of prison to his bumbling jailbird partner Sparrow (Arnold Stang), needy cripple of a wife Zosch (Eleanor Parker) and bit on the side Molly (Kim Novak.) He&#39;s trying to make it big as a drummer in a band, but until his big break comes along he&#39;s stuck doing the only other thing he was any good at other than being a junkie- dealing cards in high stakes games. And try as he might, even prison hasn&#39;t cured him of his addiction to the devil&#39;s drug- causing him to lie to and deceive all those around him and driving him to desperate measures to feed his habit. His yearning to come off it is his only motivation towards a happy ending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When people think of Frank Sinatra they generally think of classic high pitched songs like Under My Skin, New York New York and It Had to Be You. But lest anyone forget he was actually a renowned actor too and, if his performance in the acclaimed From Here to Eternity wasn&#39;t enough, he will also be remembered for this cutting edge drama, dealing with what was at the time the ultra taboo subject of drug abuse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film is often listed as one of the first to feature graphic heroin use (probably the reason behind the 15 certificate) in a time when it was a subject that was still very much pushed underground. In his portrayal of the main protagonist, Sinatra is fine, perfectly conveying the despair, desperation and sincerity of a man losing every second chance that is being given to him. His cold turkey scene is much more intense than Ewan McGregor&#39;s in Trainspotting. The first co-star to make an impression is Parker as Machine&#39;s demanding, needy cripple of a wife, using her husband&#39;s guilt and sense of duty to all the effect she can. Novak as his secret lover still manages some strong moments but is less of a star than Parker. Stang does his usual comic relief thing, as the bumbling sidekick who trails the leading man around with his waspy New York accent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Director Otto Preminger does allow the pace to drag a bit sometimes but this is still a powerfully absorbing film all the way, with plenty of unexpected twists and turns and which should be admired for being one of the first films to bring such a grim subject so powerfully to life. ****&#34;
b&#34;Jim Varney&#39;s performances as the Harem Girl and A.U. are amazingly funny--on a level surpassing Chaplin and Keaton. Linda Kash is great in her once-in-a-lifetime role as the hometown waffle waitress longing for adventure. Unfortunately, the remaining 90% of the movie was unwatchably bad due to the atrocious plot. The makers of Ernest Goes to Africa did not rise to the creative challenges inherent in low budget film production. Only worth seeing on cable.&#34;
b&#34;Bounty killer George Hilton, smooth Mexican bandit Gilbert Roland (who&#39;s great), and bank representative Edd Byrnes each try to outwit one-another while searching for a large amount of gold from one of Roland&#39;s train robberies that was hidden by a treacherous member of his gang.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though not the greatest that the genre has to offer, It&#39;s still breezy enough with a lot of light-hearted, action-filled fun and a satisfying finale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any Gun Can Play is mainly remembered for it&#39;s opening gag where George Hilton easily guns down three outlaws resembling Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, and Django.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next year, Hilton and Roland were reunited alongside Van Heflin and Klaus Kinski in the highly recommended The Ruthless Four.&#34;
b&#34;From start to finish, this 1926 classic two reeler from the Hal Roach Studios seems to sum up what was fun about the 20&#39;s. It stars the now forgotten comic genius, Charley Chase and was directed by the legendary Leo McCarey, who was unknown then but would earn his keep with Roach and graduate to greener pastures in the 30&#39;s and 40&#39;s. Recently released onto video and disc, this is one of the ten best examples of silent screen comedy and should be seen by audiences of all ages. Although today his star has virtually diminished, Charley Chase was considered the leader in the short subject comedy field in the waning years of the silents. He helped the careers of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy before they were brought together as a team, Leo McCarey and a host of other talents. It is a shame that he is all but remembered today. Check out this little gem of a film. Once you do, you will be seeking out other films from this classic comic. He had his hand in over 300 films and many of them survive. Rediscover this lost giant of a film from a bygone era and its giant star.&#34;
b&#34;I knew nothing about this film until I watched it... my brother in fact suggested I take a look. Normally, his suggestions aren&#39;t much cop however, but I was stuck for something to watch so I watched it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, to cut a long story short, I give it 10/10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film centers around two people, that meet whilst lodging at the same place. One is initially very dependant upon the institution around him, the other is a rebel. One does what he likes, the other as he&#39;s told.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the first moments of the film we quickly see the friendship between the two building, and see how they rub off a little on each other. It&#39;s a remarkable piece of work, that manages to tell a good story without twist upon twist, people leaping out of bath tubs, or superheros coming to save the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#39;s a fair amount of grit and reality in there, not everything can ever go just right - not all gulfs can ever be spanned - and this film delightfully shows the lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you watch this film, and are not impressed..... I&#39;d suggest that you don&#39;t watch anything again.&#34;
b&#39;Forget Easy Rider - Head is THE film about the 1960s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost laugh: as the Monkees reduce their entire career to a one-minute TV commercial about dandruff! See: the 50 foot Victor Mature try to figure out what the heck he\&#39;s doing in this film! Hear: Frank Zappa (with his pet cow on leash) tell Davey Jones &#34;Your music is awfully white&#34;! Experience: the Monkees\&#39; only live performance as a real rock band play the honest-to-gosh first-ever real punk-rock song (Circle Sky)! Listen: as Davey Jones sings a Harry Nielsen song about having a transsexual father! Be confused: be very confused, as confused as Terri Garr is when Mickey Dolenz makes sexual innuendos about her in her film debut! Witness: futile protests against the Vietnam War leap out of nowhere and just as quickly disappear! Watch: Mike Nesmith spit on Christmas while wearing a velvet Victorian smoking jacket in a cobwebbed Gothic horror-movie sound-stage! Let yourself drift: into the karmic bliss inspired by a comic-book version of Indian mysticism delivered by a hammy white character-actor in black-face, while Peter Tork pretends that he knows how to play a guitar! Discover: Academy Award winning director Bob Rafelson\&#39;s first feature length film, as written by Academy Award winning actor Jack Nicholson! Pretend it\&#39;s not happening: when the Monkees commit group suicide by jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge! Take drugs - take a lot of drugs: take as many drugs as the cast and crew evidently did while making this film!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Head, the Monkees revealed themselves as the angriest, snottiest entertainers in Hollywood history, bar none. It is bewildering to discover that they blamed the failure of this film on bad promo. To be sure, the promotion was virtually non-existent; but did they not recognize how angry, how down-right depressing, how self-destructive this film actually is?! I mean, this film is a trip - on bad acid - to the suicide ward of a mental hospital. The only film I know to be this depressing is Terry Gilliam\&#39;s Brazil; and like Brazil, this film reveals why life in the later 20th Century was almost unbearable - if you were lucky. It\&#39;s not simply that Western culture was suffering from serious information-overload, but the information itself was just bad, bad, more bad, and dismal. In fact, it was the overload effect itself that kept people going, since this allowed people to keep distracting themselves with one crisis or another - if news from Vietnam became too much to bear, they could turn the channel and watch a documentary on the rising unemployment rate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &#34;positive&#34; response to the reality revealed in Head was Woodstock - three days of peace and love and nudity and mud and bugs and bad food and dirty drink and poop and pee and bad acid and Peter Townsend almost killing Abbie Hoffman. All taking place behind a steel fence, under the lovingly watchful eyes of a veritable army of NY State Troopers - meaning that the &#34;freedom&#34; of Woodstock Nation was as illusory as the song John Sebastion thought he was singing while so strung out he could barely speak. &#34;500,000 assholes too stupid to come in out of the rain,&#34; was one critic\&#39;s judgment on Woodstock (I think it was Andy Warhol). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one good thing occurring there was Jimi Hendrix\&#39;s Star Spangled Banner. Two years previously, the Jimi Hendrix Experience had gone on their first National tour of America, as the warm-up band opening for - the Monkees. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See, it\&#39;s all connected somehow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You owe it to yourself - nay, you owe it to your unborn children - to see the real 1960s, only to be found on film in this bizarre, miraculous, and utterly absurd tribute to one of the more interesting capitalist scams of the later 20th Century.&#39;
b&#34;For all intents and purposes, &#39;Teen Devian&#39; might seem like just another lightweight Bollywood musical. To some extent, this might even be true, especially because the producers had to be sure that the film succeeded with the masses. But somewhere behind the scenes, either Sadashiv Brahmam (who had the &#39;idea&#39; for this story) or Amerjeet (who directed the film) decided that there would be a twist to the usual formula, and succeeded perhaps beyond even their own expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not simply about a handsome man flirting with 3 women, undecided on whom to choose as his life&#39;s partner. Dev Anand&#39;s character was really in love with each of the 3 women at various times, and they with him, despite being aware of the other two. Dev Anand&#39;s relationship with Simi and Kalpana is particularly interesting - in that each of the women comes to depend on him heavily. There are quite a lot of suggestive teasers in the stars&#39; body language that lend themselves to imagination depending on the viewer&#39;s maturity. The theme is surprisingly adult and after all that it was ashame that the ending was tame, obviously designed to please the masses and deflect criticism.&#34;
b&#39;I first saw Robin Hood: Men in Tights back in 1994 in the cinema. I went to see it because I always liked Robin Hood and I saw the trailer of this movie and thought it was hilarious. After I saw the movie I must say it was even better than I thought. Not only is it very funny, it\&#39;s also a very well made movie with beautiful sets and costumes and a very beautiful score by Hummie Mann. The acting in the movie is also good, Cary Elwes is funny as Robin Hood and also Tracey Ullman, Richard Lewis, Mark Blankfield, David Chapelle, Amy Yasbeck, Megan Cavanagh, Eric Allan Kramer, Matthew Porretta and Mel Brooks himself are funny. But the best part in the movie is played by Roger Rees as the evil Sheriff of Rottingham. He has the best scenes in the movie and also the best dialogue (&#34;King illegal forest to pig wild kill in it a is&#34;, which stands for &#34;It is illegal to kill a wild pig in the king\&#39;s forest&#34;).He somehow mixes up all the words and speaks out a sentence that nobody understands. Robin Hood: Men in Tights is in my book one of the best Mel Brooks films to date and I can\&#39;t say that I have laughed as much about a film as this one. It\&#39;s just non-stop laughing.&#39;
b&#34;WONDERBIRD, certainly an unbelievably refined cartoon, drawn in a deliciously old\xc2\x97fashioned way, and sensationally old\xc2\x97fashioned in almost any respect, takes place in a kingdom ruled by a mean and heinous monarch; accordingly, the kingdom, or at least what we see\xc2\x97the surroundings of the king&#39;s palace, seems devoid, uninhabited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few inhabitants there are\xc2\x97away from the Sun\xc2\x97in the withered underground city.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An advice\xc2\x97call it an allegory, call it a parable, only do not call it a fable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because IMDb encourages prolixity, and maybe for other reasons as well, I will add that this cartoon is the work of the great Paul Grimault.&#34;
b&#39;This film gets off to a bad start. An incredibly corny monologue is followed immediately by a brilliantly-done, truly amazing spaceship crash. Then things go downhill again, as you realize that the survivors are all a) bad actors (apart from the docking pilot and the psychopath) and b) almost all of them fit too nicely into the role of monster-fodder. Hell, half of them don\&#39;t even speak English, preventing the audience from getting to know the characters at all. You feel as if you were watching &#34;Deep Blue Sea&#34; meets &#34;Silence of the Lambs&#34;, minus the good bits. And unfortunately, the entire thing tries to hard to be &#34;Crashed on a desert planet with Hannibal Lecter&#34; during the daylight scenes. Vin Diesel is a great actor - but he is no Anthony Hopkins, and he frankly annoys as the smart hyper-cool psycho. There is at least one very good scene involving an unexpected survivor - but apart from that you could just as well have cut out the first thirty minutes or so...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then things take a turn. I can\&#39;t exactly pinpoint the moment, but soon the movie gets a lot better. It also feels less chopped - the scenes actually begin to follow each other with a consistent narrative, and Vin Diesel becomes much less annoying and soon he is a show-stealer. By the time the first monsters appear, the film is actually quite enjoyable. By the time night falls, it is great. Thrilling, horrifying and exciting. And even the character development of most main characters is well-done. If you can just sit through the poor bits at the start you\&#39;re in for some GREAT entertainment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides, the visuals are eye-candy, and I honestly admit: I love the colour and the tone of this movie. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7/10 (could have been 9/10, if only....)&#39;
b&#34;This movie is beautiful in all ways. It is visually stunning, and this is a good thing since the dialogue would only take up a page or two of paper. The acting is superb; it is subtle, passionate and intense. Ben Daniels does a fabulous job of turning himself into an animal, and mixing that wild nature with a man&#39;s overbearing passion and honor. There is not one flaw, not one mistake or wrong moment to be found anywhere. It is completely perfect, but only if you understand what you&#39;re going to experience. It isn&#39;t a movie for anyone who wants normality.&#34;
b&#34;Barry Champlain is a radio phone-in talk-show host in Dallas, whose no-holds-barred ideas on a plethora of social issues disturb and offend many of his callers and listeners. Is Barry a media messiah in search of truth, or a social misfit out to assault his audience ?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an intense, provocative character piece about a man with almost no redeeming features who at the same time seems to be onto some really profound philosophy. Though co-written and directed by Stone, this is really Bogosian&#39;s piece all the way and he gives an astonishingly hard-edged and penetrating performance from which there is no escape. Barry is at times one of the most loathsome characters imaginable, spewing bilious misanthropy at everyone around him, particularly those who care about him. But at the same time he is also strangely empathetic, hypnotic, sage, even lovable. Bogosian&#39;s hawkish features burn into the frame, with his green eyes constantly darting around as if permanently seeking an answer to some riddle. The movie is essentially an angry, self-righteous rant against all the bigotry, injustice and banality in the world, culminating in a wild three-and-a-half-minute rotating single shot of Barry delivering the ultimate I-hate-everything speech, but boy does it pack a punch. The support cast are great, particularly Greene as the ex-wife and Baldwin as the boss. Robert Richardson&#39;s keen photography manages to keep the single radio studio set looking interesting and there&#39;s a tense score by Stewart Copeland, with a moving coda featuring that endearing phone-music piece, Telephone And Rubber Band by The Penguin Cafe Orchestra. If you&#39;re unfamiliar with Bogosian, check out his amazing talent in this flick - like his contemporaries, Bill Hicks and Denis Leary, he&#39;s someone who rarely appears in the mainstream media, purely because his writing is so out there. I find Stone&#39;s movies variable; I don&#39;t much care for his big successes, but when he is more ordered and objective, as with this (or Salvador and Nixon), he is much more incisive and arresting. A great primal scream of a picture, based on a play by Bogosian, inspired by the true story of Alan Berg, a Denver radio talk show host who was murdered by neo-Nazis in 1984.&#34;
b&#34;A great film. Every moment masterfully conducted by Toyoda and his crew. The actors give credible performances all around.The visuals are haunting,beautiful and sometimes hauntingly beautiful shots of the Japanese country and city landscapes.The sounds,courtesy of Japanese band &#39;Dig&#39;, are never overly edgy as one would expect from band-made soundtracks. It&#39;s strangely atmospheric and well suited to the scenes they&#39;re on. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, they worked everything out perfectly....Well, if they were to give any justice to the story, perfection is the only thing anyone could have accepted. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real greatness of 9 Souls is the compelling story. The prison break movie maybe something of a lost genre these days, and road trip movie losing it&#39;s appeal due to the way the world is getting smaller. But this story easily mixes something fresh to those two genres.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9 convicts are given freedom and possibly the opportunity to regain their places in society. will society accept them? will they be truly free of their dark pasts? and can they stick together long enough to stay alive and find out? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each convict has an interesting history. Their crimes are as varied as their apparent fates. A sense of brotherhood among them keeps the story high on drama and supplies it with hilariously comedic situations. And due to the nature of their backgrounds, violence is always something waiting to happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all that, all i can say is go give it a watch.&#34;
b&#39;Making a movie about a Comic is hard to do. Making a good movie about a Comic is extremely hard to do. Making a good movie about Asterix &amp; Obelix has been done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie shows that the french do know how to make an : a) funny , b) hilarious , c) beautiful , d) superb movie. The acting is no less than superb , the sunny feel to the whole movie is perfect .. A MUST see ! This just has to be the funniest thing to come out since we started the new millenium.. 10/10&#39;
b&#39;The third film from the Polish brothers is their best, most beautiful, imaginative film yet. Though many audiences will have a problem with Northfork\&#39;s lack of traditional dramatic structure, &#34;Stick with it, Jack!&#34;. The plot is difficult to summarize, so just know that the story includes: agents trying to evacuate a city, God in a cowboy hat, the selling of angel wings, and a sick orphan (but it all works). M. David Mullen\&#39;s extraordinary photography makes almost every frame exciting and wonderful to look at. The performances of the actors, working with the Polish Brothers\&#39; inspiringly offbeat script, are pitch-perfect and give the film its emotional punch. The strong-willed audience member will be moved by the mythology and folk tale of the story, the comic and moving actors, and finally the incredible courage and command that Michael Polish shows behind the camera. Again all of these incredible and seemingly disjointed elements come together magnificently in one of the most incredible things you should run out and experience. A great, great, great movie!!!&#39;
b&#34;John Leguizamo is a great comedian and storyteller. Every time this has been on HBO I&#39;ve had to stop and watch it. John tells the story of how he grew up (probably some fact and fiction) and adds hilarious stories in the midst. If you like John&#39;s comedy I would have to say this is probably his comedy at his best.&#34;
b&#34;While in one country, Spain, Luis Bunuel and Salvador Dali combined forces to create the benchmark of short-subject, cinematic surrealism, Un Chien Andalou, Walt Disney and his collaborator Ub Iwerks in America worked on Steamboat Willie, the most prominent of the early synchronized sound cartoons (it was revealed that this was not the first, contrary to other reports). It&#39;s also one of the more successfully simplistic and funny of the Mickey Mouse shorts (still in a silent-film way- the only sounds are little irks and bleeps from the Mickey and the animals). It also goes by fairly quickly for its less-than-ten minute run. But in these minutes one gets the immediate sense of how much fun Disney has with his characters, and how the newfound use of sound changes how his creation uses the animals as musical tools. There&#39;s no story to speak of, just random things that happens and occurs because of Mickey (err, Steamboat Willie) on this boat on a river. And like the better Mickey Mouse shorts, his lack of speaking acts as an advantage. It&#39;s a must-see if you haven&#39;t seen it as a kid, but if you have it might still be worth another look.&#34;
b&#34;I saw UZUMAKI about a year ago and was mesmerized. The only Japanese horror film I had seen before this one was KWAIDAN (Which I proudly own on DVD, by the way), superb! The idea of a town being absorbed by spirals sounds exactly like something out of Lovecraft. Certainly it reminds one of SHADOW OVER INNSMOUTH, of the inhabitants slowly turning into monstrosities (in this case giant snails). And who can forget the washing machine sequence? I hope we will soon see this one available on Region 1 DVD (I see that Sundance has recently screened it on US TV, hopefully they&#39;ll do it again very soon) so that we can all see it. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!&#34;
b&#34;This movie was really funny. The people that were expecting to see an Oscar worthy comedy, should get over themselves. This was a fun movie to see with interesting and funny characters, plot lines, dialog quotes and catch phrases. I rate a movie a 10 if I have bought the DVD, or in this case, the videotape, and have watched it many times, and in this case, still laugh out loud. I have about 12 movies in my collection with a rating of 10 and about half don&#39;t have anything do do with the Oscars. Again, this was just a fun, light-hearted movie. I hope this comes out on DVD. I highly suggest checking this movie out, if you are in the mood for a wacky comedy.&#34;
b&#39;I thought this was a very good TV series and I would like to see it continue. It really got interesting there at the end and I really want to see where it is going from there. Some times we are to quick to kill a series without giving it a chance. I think this one needs a chance to go on, and I will definitely be waiting for it. The ocean is one of the places that man knows so little about and I think that is a mystery in itself. What is waiting for us beneath the waters of the world. It is even said that man maybe crawled out or slivered out of the waters many millennium ago. Is this a new evolution coming about? Are we going to move down the food chain or fight for our position?&#39;
b&#34;NVA combines eastalgia-humor, military comedy and teen movie. Although it is somehow typically German-movie-like sentimental, I think it&#39;s a great and very funny movie. You will not only laugh in NVA but also get a bit of an insight in the Eastern Germany armed forces of the late 1980ies and how the young recruits as well as the professional soldiers experienced the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the German Democratic Republic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will enjoy NVA if you liked Sonnenallee (another movie directed by Leander Hau\xc3\x9fmann), but not necessarily if you enjoyed Good Bye Lenin which is much more serious and less obviously funny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting is acceptable. But watch for former boy band singer Kim Frank who has only two facial expressions: natural and shocked saucer-eyed!&#34;
b&#34;There have been approximately 60 different films &amp; Television plays,besides the classic Opera of this tale of a sex mad girl and her hapless soldier lover. This story has been done so many times, in various ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vicente Aranda directs Joaquin Jorda&#39;s screenplay adaptation of Prosper Merimee&#39;s classic novel &amp; play.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the story ONLY of Bizet&#39;s opera Carmen&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pas Vega is an exciting Carmen,full of passion &amp; the ability to drive simple men to do terrible tragic things. Leonardo Sbaraglio is the hapless soldier who is ensnared into Carmen&#39;s poisonous web &amp; led to doing bad things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jay Benedict is the author Prosper who tells this tale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is not much action, BUT there are some very hot sex scenes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact this is almost an NC-17 film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;since I have seen this tale so often in so many guises I was not overly impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a very well made film &amp; will be of interest to those that may not know of it,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My not overly enthusiastic review also could be that I miss the fantastic Opera score by Bizet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See this as you may like it more than I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ratings *** (out of 4) 82 points (out of 100) IMDb 7 (out of 10)&#34;
b&#34;This film is my favorite comedy of all time and I have seen a lot of comedies.First of all,I should not this film had no script.Just a storyboard.The dialogue is almost completely written by the actors.Which makes this film absolutely hsyterical.The cast is one of the best comedic ensemble&#39;s you will ever see.The story is about the Mayflower Dog Show in Philadelphia and some of the contestants in them.Parker Posey shines and is absolutely great!This is one of those films that most of the laughing comes from the absolute pathetic-ness of the characters.*****/*****&#34;
b&#34;I was cast as the Surfer Dude in the beach scenes. Almost got cast as the muscle guy, since the real muscle guy was really really late that day. Pauly had my brother and I (the skateboarder in front of the tattoo place) do some vj stuff in between takes live from Venice since he was still doing his MTV thing. This movie is really good as well. Would it have made my top 100 if I wasn&#39;t in it........?&#34;
b&#39;i see hundreds of student films- this is tops. james cox is a fantastic director- he moves the camera, tells the story and uses music in a way that is far advanced for his years. no wonder he got a feature from this film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;
b&#39;wow! i just have to say this show is super cool! i fell in love with the show from the beginning! the idea of the show is very original and very soothing! it\&#39;s also a pleasure to watch the performance the two lovely leading ladies give, Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel! they\&#39;re simply wonderful! i\&#39;m especially a big admirer of Lauren Graham! she\&#39;s not just a pretty face, she\&#39;s a &#34;monster&#34; of an actress as well! i\&#39;m not saying that Alexis isn\&#39;t a wonderful actress as well... i just happen to like Lauren better! anyway it\&#39;s a real delight seeing them on screen, &#34;sparing&#34; with words! in the words of the immortal Jim Carrey &#34;B-E-A-UTIFUL!&#34;&#39;
b&#39;Notorious HK CATIII actor, Anthony Wong, is for once (well...not actually once - he was a cop in the DAUGHTER OF DARKNESS films and a few others...)not a psychopathic weirdo in EROTIC NIGHTMARE. Usually recognized for his role as a complete wackadoo in such CATIII &#34;nasties&#34; like THE UNTOLD STORY and THE EBOLA SYNDROME - this time, Wong is on the receiving-end of the nastiness...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wong plays a guy who goes to a sorcerer who promises to give him really good dreams, for a price. True to his word, the dreams that Wong has involve having mad donkey sex with smokin\&#39; hot schoolgirls - but the dreams come with a price that\&#39;s more than money. The sorcerer can manipulate the dreams and with the help of a sexy ghost, blackmails Wong out of his cash and business, kills his family, and eventually kills Wong himself...Wong\&#39;s brother comes to town to find out what\&#39;s going on, and eventually finds that his family\&#39;s murder is the work of the evil sorcerer - but as it turns out - Wong\&#39;s brother is a pretty dope-ass sorcerer himself, and with the help of the sorcerer\&#39;s abused wife - turns the tables on the sorcerer and his schemes...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EROTIC NIGHTMARE is one of the more enjoyable CATIII films I\&#39;ve seen in a while. Absent is the gritty and dark feel of some of the other CATIII entries like RED TO KILL, THE UNTOLD STORY or HUMAN PORK CHOP - EROTIC NIGHTMARE, though still sleazy in terms of sex and subject matter, is more &#34;fun&#34; then some of the more serious films of the genre. More comparable to ETERNAL EVIL OF ASIA - a more &#34;carefree&#34; CATIII entry that delivers plenty in terms of nudity and a good bit of gore, without being overly comedic either. Definitely worth a look, especially to the genre enthusiast. 8/10&#39;
b&#39;This movie may be the best ever if you like watching movies and laughing and then subjecting your friends to watch those movies too. If you\&#39;re anything like me, and you probably are, you\&#39;ll be laughing for years to come at the jokes in this movie. One of the funniest parts is when Gus sharks some money off a guy with kids and then the guy takes those kids into the forest like Hansel and Gretel then he and his wife go home with them. The soup scene kitchen is rife with comic genius of buffoonery: &#34;Inspection officer -- Here!&#34; and the lines to follow will stay in my mind forever probably. When I have shown this movie to my friends, they usually say &#34;What was that?!?&#34; so if you\&#39;re in the mood for one of those types of movies, yippee! This movie is so OOP it\&#39;s not funny anymore, so probably the easiest way to get it would be online auctioning. The first time I saw it was from a rental.&#39;
b&#34;[CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Garfield and his owner Jon Arbuckle were in a rut. They basically had no life at all. All they did was lay around and count the ceiling tiles. Jon even organized his sock drawer according to color and fabric. He needed a life. So he consults a book on the subject that tells him to meet a woman. A singles&#39; bar was a great place to start. Unfortunately, when the music started and Jon hit the dance floor, we see what made disco die: Jon killed it. Jon next tried to pick up girls at the video store. He ended up feeling down in the mouth. Literally. The laundromat was no prize either when Jon and his would-be date get a glimpse of each other&#39;s underwear. Jon tried to act all buff at the beach, but soon he angered a real buff guy, which left Jon feeling, once again, down in the mouth. Literally. Jon then tried to pick up girls walking and jogging by. No avail. Jon pulled out a guitar and sings the blues. Unfortunately when he mentioned his cat being fat, a fat man walked up and stomped Jon&#39;s guitar. It was hopeless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Fortunately for Jon, an ad flashed on the TV: an ad for Lorenzo&#39;s School for the Personality Impaired. It guaranteed a lifeless person to get a life in a few easy steps. Jon and Garfield attend the class. The building didn&#39;t exactly look the same way it did on TV, nor did Lorenzo act as peppy as he did on TV. Jon sat next to a pretty girl named Mona. So while Lorenzo taught his lessons of introducing yourself, checking your pulse, and pretending to speak a foreign language, Jon and Mona get to know one another. They leave together, forgetting all about Garfield. At home, Jon and Mona just sat on the porch and talked. Garfield was jealous of Mona for fear that she would take Jon away from him. Garfield envisioned the future: Jon and Mona get married, she moves in, and soon she gives birth to a little Arbuckle who is overjoyed at pulling Garfield&#39;s tale. Back to the present, Garfield would not stand for it. He tried to get Jon to get rid of Mona, until she started scratching behind his ears. But then Jon learned that Mona was allergic to cats. So that was basically the end of their relationship. But they still saw each other every now and then, and Garfield was sure to be with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Another hilarious Garfield TV special! This one was made during the run of TV&#39;s Garfield and Friends. Garfield was slimmed down somewhat. SOMEwhat. Since hie early 1980&#39;s cartoons. The scenes of Jon trying to pick up chicks is funny, so is the one where the fat guy stomps on Jon&#39;s guitar. Good ol&#39; Lorenzo Music is back as Garfield. Thom Huge is Jon. Frank Welker (The third man of 1,000 voices) is Lorenzo. And June Foray (The woman of 1,000 voices) is Mona. If you like Garfield, then I recommend you see Garfield Gets A Life today! It, along with Here Comes Garfield, and Garfield on the Town, were just released on DVD! So check them all out today! You are guaranteed a good time. Hey, has Garfield ever let you down before?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-&#34;
b&#39;Wrestlemania 6, is an entertaining Wrestlemania, if not an entirely successful one. The Ultimate Challenge, is of course worth the price of admission alone, but once again as with a lot of the early Mania\&#39;s, there\&#39;s too much filler in between. The crowd pops for almost everything, and as always, giving us the reliable announcing team of Gorilla&amp;The Body. Having a Face vs Face match as the main event for a Wrestlemania, was absolutely unheard of at this time, it only made things that much more tense. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matches. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Koko B. Ware/W Frankie Vs &#34;The Model&#34; Rick Martel. For a 3 or so minute match, this is as good as it gets. I wish it was a tad longer, but what I got, was pretty damn good. Martel wins, with the Boston Crab.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 1/2 /5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WWF Tag Team Championship. Demolition Vs Colossal Connection|C|/W Bobby Heean. HUGE Pop for Demolition. Match itself is pretty dull, I often had trouble paying attention. Andre really didn\&#39;t do much, so in a way it was more like a 2 on 1. There is solid talent involved here, and it\&#39;s a shame they couldn\&#39;t produce better. Demolition wins that titles, with there Pattened maneuver off the top. Crowd blows the roof of for the finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 1/2 /5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Earthquake/W Jimmy Hart. Vs Hercules I got what I expected here, a standard boring filler match, with Earthquake doing his thing. I\&#39;m not really a fan of either, so It didn\&#39;t perk my interest much. Quake wins with his sit down splash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brutus Beefcake Vs Mr.Pefect/W The Genius. Deafening pop for Bruti. Really good match up, with sadly not enough time given to develop even further. It really kept my interest, and remains one of my favorites on the card. Beefcake wins with a slingshot to the post, much to the crowd\&#39;s approval.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Roddy Piper Vs Bad News Brown. HUGE pop for Piper. Nothing more than a boring brawl, that does not know what it wants to be. Some entertaining antics from The Hot Rod, but nothing else. Noteworthy for Roddy painting himself half black, and calling himself &#34;Hot Scott&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Hart Foundation Vs The Bolsheviks. Record breaking, but other than that, nothing to see here. Harts win with, The Hart Attack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;0/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Barbarian/W Bobby Heenan. Vs Tito Santana. Average for the time it got, but watchable nonetheless. Crowd was rather dead for it, except for Heenan\&#39;s interference. Jessie\&#39;s hilarious cracks, about Tito\&#39;s food is more entertaining, then the match itself. Barbarian wins with a nasty looking, flying clothesline off the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mixed Tag Match. Dusty&amp;Sapphire/W Elizabeth. Vs Macho King&amp;Sherri. Big pop for Dusty, and an even bigger one for Elizabeth, who looks absolutely stunning, might I add. I thought it was OK. It was lively at least, if nothing that great. I\&#39;m not a fan of Dusty\&#39; so. Dusty and Sapphire win, when She rolls up Sherri.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Orient Express/W Fuji. Vs The Rockers. Crowd is rather anemic for this, surprisingly. Decent no doubt, but with these guys involved, it should have been better. The constant focus with Fuji, kinda detracts from the match. Express wins by count out, when Janetty gets nailed with salt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 1/2 /5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jim Duggan Vs Dino Bravo/W Earthquake&amp;Jimmy Hart. Duggan like an idiot, brings out The American flag in Canada. Duggan gets some solid boo\&#39;s for it too, but that also may be due to Bravo\&#39;s Canadian heritage. Crappy match all around, I don\&#39;t care for Duggan, but that\&#39;s not why it sucked. Too short in the end, to really matter. Duggan wins when he whacks Bravo in the back, with the two by four. Duggan gets splashed for his troubles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;0/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Million Dollar Championship. Ted Dibiase|C|/W Virgil. Vs Jake Robers/W Damien. Some slow spots, but when all was said and done, I had a good time. Two solid wrestlers giving it there all, resulted in an entertaining match up. Crowd noticeably gets Ancy during parts of it though, by doing the wave. Dibiase wins by count out. Jake has the last laugh, by giving away some of his money, much to the crowd\&#39;s delight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big Bossman Vs Akeem/W Slick. Nice pop for The Bossman. Too routine, and too short to really mean anything, in the end. Akeem was a gimmick, I was never too fond of. Bossman wins with his slam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;0/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Rhythm&amp;Blues segment was pretty much a failure. Crowd wasn\&#39;t into it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rick Rude/W Bobby Heenan. Vs Jimmy Snuka. For a filler match, before the main event, this wasn\&#39;t too bad. If it had time to get going more, it would have been excellent, for sure. Rude wins, with the Rude Awakening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Title For Title. Ultimate Warrior|IC Champ| Vs Hulk Hogan|WWF Champ| This one is all about the atmosphere from the crowd, and the split crowd reaction, for the most part. Warrior got a pretty decent pop, but in my opinion it was a little underwhelming. Hogan dwarfs it completely,with his. It\&#39;s one of Wrestlemania\&#39;s best matches in history. With two people, who aren\&#39;t really known for there wrestling, they managed to create an amazing match up that was talked about for ages. I have seen this many times, and my respect level grows higher for each one, for their effort, considering i\&#39;m not a fan of either. Even die-hard fanatics who crave pure wrestling, can\&#39;t bitch about this one!. Warrior wins with his splash. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line. Wrestlemania 6 is an entertaining entry, if nothing overly special. It\&#39;s memorable for the main event, the location, and the crowd, but it\&#39;s not one of the best if you ask me. That being said I do enjoy it, and I give it my recommendation to fellow wrestling fans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7/10&#39;
b&#34;For once a Barbie movie that is good. I&#39;m 18 and a embarrassed to say this but I&#39;m hooked on these movies. I hated Barbie when I was younger but the movies I love. Shiver is so cute and I&#39;ve fallen in love with him. He&#39;s so cute as the polar bear and totally in love with Aiden. Oh man I&#39;m in love with Shiver. I love Annika determination not to give up on hope and eventfully it works. I love this movie and hopefully they will be other good ones. Barbie &amp; Swan Lake is other brilliant movie. I would recommend this movie to children of all ages (even boys) because the movie is that good and I&#39;m hard to please. Barbie and the Magic of Pegasus is a movie that is enchanting and exciting.&#34;
b&#39;This film is well cast, often silly and always funny. Lemmon and Matthau work their tag team magic to perfection. Brent Spiner is just a riot as the egotistical tyrant of a cruise director. From the first &#34;hare krishna&#34; to the last &#34;you ought pay him fifty bucks for calling you two studs&#34;, I thought this was a totally entertaining fun comedy&#39;
b&#39;&#34;Walking with Dinosaurs&#34; is absolutely brilliant in every regard. Kenneth Branagh narrates in a way that really makes you want to listen. The script for the documentary really sounds as though the researchers and writers had done their homework, it is so insightful and it does get you hooked and never lets go. The music is also brilliant, very dramatic when it needs to be. But the visual effects and scenery are what makes this documentary work so well. The scenery is breathtaking, and the dinosaurs look so real, thanks to the simply astounding effects. This is so informative with such a good concept and attracts not only adults but kids too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, this is a must watch. Not only did I love this, but this is quite possibly the best documentary I have ever seen. If anything, it could have done with being longer, other than that this is perfect. 10/10 Bethany Cox&#39;
b&#39;I don\&#39;t know why all of the critics say this was a bad movie, this is one of my all-time favorite movies. Tommy (Chris Farley) and Richard (David Spade) are a great match. Tommy is the stupid one who spent seven years in college, finally passing with a D+. Richard is the smart kid who was hated by everyone in school. How can you not laugh when the two of them are singing &#34;Superstar&#34; by The Carpenters passionatly and all of a sudden the hood pops up? In all this is a great movie, I recommend it.&#39;
b&#34;Much about this movie was beautiful. The acting, the scenery, and without a doubt, Aaron&#39;s cinematography background showed through on the beautiful shots. Definitely worth watching, as your attention will be captivated the entire time, and it ends on just the right note.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting by newcomer Jonathan Furr was superb, as one would think he was a pro acting since he was born. He has gone on to act in other feature films, but this starring role will always be remembered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film does have that academy award feel to it at times, where it&#39;s slow and scenic and quiet, so it&#39;s not a movie that a.d.d. kids can sit through. However, the rustic feel of East Bend and Yadkinville played out well as a 1940&#39;s era film.&#34;
b&#34;I was trying to work out why I enjoyed this film?? Its not because of money spent on it that&#39;s for sure!! Did I see a painted water pistol in there? Maybe they don&#39;t have the same sort of visual effects houses in the Scotland? Or maybe they just didn&#39;t have any money? The making of clearly shows a gang of very plucky guys making a movie against the odds. Awesome! But what I really liked was the grit of the performances. Mike Michell and Patrick White play the lead parts like 2 normal guys. No Hollywood histrionics here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, so the effects work isn&#39;t very good. The spaceships just don&#39;t look as good as they should in todays FX world and I&#39;ve seen much better free stuff on youtube. But the film holds together very well once they get to the Planet. Was this filmed in Scotland or just by a Scottish crew? Or is it just better effects work? Did they edit out the water? By the end I kinda loved this film and was disappointed when they all died.&#34;
b&#34;Good Movie, acting was terrific especially from Eriq Ebouaney(Lumumba)and very well directed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also shows how Lumumba was cornered by the Belgians, U S A and United Nations and how they labelled him a `communist&#39; to scare people as they did to all the Honest True African leaders like Nkrumah, Kenyatta, Nyerere and many others. It shows how western countries preach democracy while they have something else on the back of their minds. It is a story of injustice, struggle and brutality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It shows how Lumumba couldn&#39;t control his people, yes they were his people, but before we put the blame on him, was he getting enough if any from the people he appointed in his government like Mobutu? Or his colleague had other things in their minds, to find out go and see the movie! Certainly Mobutu did, went on to loot the country for the next 35 yrs, before he was overthrown and fled the country. Died a billionaire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some flaws: There was too little explanation how the man (Lumumba) got to rise in the first place. Also there should have been more explanation about the country, Congo Kinshasa (after independence), now known as Democratic Republic of Congo formerly known as Zaire when it was under Mobutu. There should have been an explanation why he (Lumumba) couldn&#39;t keep the second largest country in Africa in one piece. And also what was going on with Tshombe and Katanga . Just heads up if you gonna watch the movie Tshombe was controlling the Katanga region which (if I am not mistaken) is the number one copper producer in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all it is a good movie to see. You will learn something new about Africa, it&#39;s leaders and it&#39;s people and probably will open your eyes why this continent is ridden with wars.&#34;
b&#34;Pavarotti and the entire cast are superb in this beautifully filmed opera by Giuseppe Verdi, the world&#39;s finest composer of operas. The coloratura soprano is particularly spectacular with her perfect pitch. The title role is well-enacted and well-sung. The entire production is as perfect as one could expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A masterpiece of cinematography!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;
b&#39;Seven Ups has been compared to Bullitt for the chase scene, but does not come anywhere near matching Bullitt. Bullitt has a beginning that builds builds builds. When McQueen leaves the seedy hotel, gets into his Mustang, which is parked under the Embarcadero Freeway (now torn down) and notices the Charger sitting nearbye, you know you are about to see something spectacular. From that moment on, when McQueen starts that car, begins the best car chase sequence ever filmed. Adding to it is a terrific Lalo Schriffin If I remember correctly sound track. This goes on for a long time before you actually hear the first tires squealing. That shot of McQueen\&#39;s Mustang suddenly appearing in Bill Hickman\&#39;s rear view mirror is unmatched for visual impact. Hickman\&#39;s look of surprise and double take really adds to the effect. Then of course, San Francisco is unmatched for the setting of cars racing up and down hills and around bends. Also, Bullitt being filmed in the 60s when cars were still &#34;Hot&#34; (Mustang GT and Dodge Charger) made for a better set of wheels then two boring, smog device laden Pontiacs in the 1970s Seven Ups. Bill Hickman was the driver of the bad guy car in both movies. I saw him sitting at an insider movie preview once on the Univeral lot when I was doing movie reviews for a paper. They gave it a good try in Seven Ups though with the chase scene. Seven ups had a few &#34;jumps&#34; over little hills, (Yawn) but of course they were not San Francisco hills. The Seven Ups chase, where they are actually going fast, is longer than the go fast sequence in Bullitt. But the scene of a single shotgun blast totally blowing the hood OFF of Roy Schieders Pontiac is the height of absurdity. Strictly Hollywood, I would say, except that it was filmed in New York.&#39;
b&#34;I can understand how Barney can be annoying to some, but the hatred he gets is very ridiculous. Barney was made simply right from the beginning and simplicity isn&#39;t bad, especially for the young ones he entertains. I personally find this show to be very underrated period. Barney &amp; Friends is a very educational show in my opinion and even 17 years after its debut (and nearly 21 years after the character&#39;s debut on home video), he proves time and time again that he still appeals to young children. Maybe less so than in the early 90&#39;s where Barney was the Hannah Montana of the time, but he&#39;s still a classic. As a fan of Barney myself, I feel that I should defend him in a way that doesn&#39;t seem like spam. The way the purple guy teaches things may be very simplistic and unrealistic, but would you rather have them hearing about war? Be thankful some one (a costumed dinosaur, but still) is there to comfort kids and let them be kids simply. In this day and age, I feel that we rush our kids to grow up and Barney is there to say you can still be a child at heart. In addition, many of Barney&#39;s lessons on current episodes about plagiarism, being honest, and yes... even death, could appeal to everyone, not just his target audience. Besides, our children need to learn to be kind and respect others for who they are, and he helps them do that. In short, Barney may be annoying to some people and I completely understand why, but cut him some slack. All he and his friends (along with HIT Entertainment, his production company) are trying to do is help kids not only learn necessary skills, but to have fun and to also look at the positive parts of life. If more people listened to their children&#39;s favorite character and viewed him through their eyes, maybe we wouldn&#39;t be so negative about him and possibly life itself.&#34;
b&#34;I can&#39;t believe this isn&#39;t a huge cult hit. Perhaps people in 1968, thinking of the Monkees as a silly factory-made pop band rip-off of the Beatles, refused to see it. That cynicism probably covered it from sight ever since. Don&#39;t make this mistake. _Head_ is an amazing film that most open minded people will appreciate. It is very funny and very intelligent (and very trippy).&#34;
b&#39;I must admit when I saw the preview for &#34;Inglorious Basterds&#34; I gave myself big expectations. THIS FILM DID NOT Disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rarely when I watch a movie with such high-expectations do I have those expectations met or exceeded; this film did that and more. Even more rarely do I clap at the end of a movie, this I and everyone else in the theater did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say I am a little biased towards Quentin, I grew up with &#34;Pulp Fiction.&#34; I watched it when I was 12 and it is still my favorite and most influential film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, since then Quentin has not really lived up to his billing. His style was getting a little predictable instead of familiar, the quality honestly wasn\&#39;t there (I never watched Jackie Brown, and then there\&#39;s Grindhouse). That is until &#34;Inglorious Basterds.&#34; What Quentin did was exactly what was needed for the war genre, a spaghetti western feel that could only be done by Tarantino or Sergio Leone, but seeing how Leone is dead, Tarantino\&#39;s the self appointed guy on this masterpiece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So let\&#39;s look at the movie which I won\&#39;t give away. The writing was spot on, a beautiful transition between using not one but four different languages in this movie. Not to mention this movie was set up in the classic Tarantino mold, great scenes of rich meaningful dialog and sudden shocking action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting was superb!! Christopher Waltz deserves an Oscar, seriously. I don\&#39;t say that often, but honestly the man should get one for this movie, he spoke every language in this movie, and delivered with such amazing touch and poise. He stole the show in a movie that everybody was amazingly impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no problem building this movie up, because this movie is the best film I\&#39;ve seen all year, and probably all of next year. Quite frankly the more I think about it, this movie may crack my top films of all time, and is Quentin\&#39;s best movie since &#34;Pulp Fiction.&#34; Take it from me, watch this film. I loved it doesn\&#39;t do this movie enough justice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I watched it yesterday and I\&#39;m still blown away. Thank you Quentin from the bottom of my heart for you making this movie. You\&#39;re back on top again buddy. I can\&#39;t say enough for &#34;Inglorious Basterds!&#34;&#39;
b&#34;All I have to say is that this movie is the bomb. You are going to cry when you see this. I mean, this is a reminder for everyone how hard and easy it is to fall in love. It reminds you of the days during your youth when you were carefree and everything that was bad for you was washed away with a single kiss. Even though I am still a teen, this is how I live my life. When I am with that certain someone, everything that was negative in my mind was erased. So, I give this movie a 10 for it&#39;s heartfelt message and touching plot. Actors Josh Hartnett and Chris Klein I also give a 10 for having a cute face.&#34;
b&#39;During the Clete Roberts preface, I was beginning to think this was an Ed Wood production, however, what rolls out here is some pretty hard hitting stuff. The story of crime and corruption in a Southern town is told using a cast culled from Hollywood\&#39;s Poverty Row, and this makes the movie all the more realistic. There are no punches pulled here, and at times the film is reminiscent of &#34;The Well&#34;(1951). The Black and White texture gives a newsreel-like quality. For certain, younger viewers will be reminded of &#34;The Blair Witch Project&#34; but this one IS based on REAL events!&#39;
b&#34;The 1978 adaptation had all the ingredients of a potentially wonderful film. It is based on an absolutely charming book by Charles Kingsley. It has a truly talented cast from the likes of James Mason, Bernard Cribbons and David Tomblinson, not to mention the vocal talents of David Jason and Jon Pertwee. There is also Lionel Jeffries, the director of wonderful classics such as The Railway Children and the Amazing Mr Blunden, and while the film is good on the most part, it was also a little disappointing. I had no problem with the performances, particularly those of Mason and Tomblinson as Grimes and Sir John Harriet respectively, and Tommy Pender and Samantha Gates are believable as Tom and Ellie. The voice cast is also commendable, especially Jon Pertwee, voicing charming characters in their own right. I also liked the incidental music it is so haunting and beautiful, and the script was fairly faithful and in general well-written, particularly at the beginning. The characters, especially the Water Babies are very charming, and the villains are sinister and funny at the same time, I loved the part when Tom and his friends help the Water Babies escape, seeing the shark chasing the electric eel with an axe was very funny. However, I will say the film does look dated, especially the animation sequences, the live action parts weren&#39;t so bad, if you forgive the rather dark camera-work. The character animation was rather flat, and the backgrounds sometimes were a little dull, though there were some nice moments, like the scene with the Krakon and of course the first meeting with the Water Babies. I also had mixed feelings about the songs, the Water Babies&#39;s song was beautiful, but I found the first song forgettable, when Tom ends up underwater. Hi-Cockallorum is an example of a song, that is like marmite, you either love it or hate it. I personally don&#39;t know what to make of this song, it was fun to listen to at first, but once it&#39;s in your head, it is perhaps annoying. As much as I like Lionel Jeffries and his films, his direction just lacked the wonder and the magic it usually does. All in all, certainly not a terrible film, but could have been better artistically. 7/10 Bethany Cox.&#34;
b&#39;Chris Morris\&#39; Brass Eye TV series had always generated a large number of complaints, both from the audience and from the people taking part. But, nothing he has done has managed to stir up more controversy than this. The 2001 Brass Eye Special. Before the hugely overrated Jerry Springer Opera arrived, the Brass Eye Special held the record for the most complaints received about any TV program ever aired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sheer volume of complaints that the general public made towards the Brass Eye Special was unbelievable! Many complaints were voiced by people who never even watched the program! The subject that the program handled turned many heads, but the message was widely misinterpreted. The message was even lost on some who enjoyed the program. This was not a show that mocked the subject of paedophilia. The show was purely about the media and it\&#39;s presentation of the subject. Morris, is and always will be, a media satirist. The notion that the program \&#39;makes fun\&#39; of paedophiles and children who have been abused is completely laughable! Morris never attempts to do either such thing. He merely draws our attention to the overwhelming, and very often stupid media hype surrounding the subject.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using many of his established \&#39;Brass Eye\&#39; characters, such as, Ted Maul and others, Morris shows just how much the media over blow every little thing about a subject that they themselves created and built up, and the result is as funny, if not funnier, than anything Morris has done previously. Using his tried and tested formula, Morris manages to trick several gullible celebrities into believing that they are working on a serious documentary. In actuality, they are made to look like exactly what they are. Retards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, the Brass Eye Special needs to be seen to be believed. And, with one opening line, Morris manages to sum up the entire media situation as it stood in 2001: &#34;Welcome to Paedo-Gedden!&#34;&#39;
b&#39;I gave this show a chance because of Jaleel White, not for his Urkel character, but mainly for the Sonic the Hedgehog voice XD So anyway, like I said, I gave it a chance, and I was very fond of it. I never cared for the Urkel character, so I was pleased to see Mr. White in a role other than the ever-so-annoying nerd. And his Calvin J. Fraiser (first called Calvin, but come the second episode, everyone started calling him &#34;J&#34;) was very entertaining and interesting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think my favorite episode was when J was dating the ex-Cowboys cheerleader with the snobby kid. (&#34;Don\&#39;t you talk that way \&#39;bout my momma!&#34; &#34;This is grown-up talk, you stay down there!&#34;) The only beef I have is that the show was suppose to have 3 main characters, but Mr. White\&#39;s character always seemed to have the most attention and the other two (who are married) always had the back stories... It isn\&#39;t exactly a good thing when a story about those two possibly being pregnant takes backseat to J. having to babysit his girlfriend\&#39;s dog.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I really wish this show could have lasted a little longer. Unfortunetely, it seems that people weren\&#39;t interested in Jaleel White as something other than the God-Awful annoying ass nerd known as Urkel....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope they at least put it out as a DVD box set.&#39;
b&#34;We stumbled across this show one Sunday morning at 6:30 a.m. while flipping through all of the cable channels and this turned out to be best show on! It is absolutely adorable. We need shows like this for children (and adults, as I&#39;m certainly way beyond my childhood years.) As one of the other commentaries pointed out, this show benefits from the simplicity of the characters and story lines. The puppets are fantastically cute, the backgrounds are colorful and even though they are created out of cardboard, foam, paint, and pure imagination, they remind us of our own childhoods, when we could spend the day at our own grandma&#39;s house, exploring the world around us. For those who never were lucky to have a grandma as nice as Nana, this show is for you, you&#39;ll make up for lost time! This show is a true inspiration and filled with cleverness and humor and just outright fun, for children and adults alike. In other words, don&#39;t overlook this show, just because you&#39;re over the age of three! Spend a half hour with Mona, Nana, Mr. Wooka, and Russell, they&#39;ll be friends you look forward to seeing!&#34;
b&#34;It must be so difficult to tell a story where not much happens, yet still grip the viewers attention. I think this short film achieves this with effortless quality. Rutger has an amazing voice that is very soothing, wise and fatherly, (I&#39;m not gay) it reminds of the qualities that Robert Redford has in narrating. The end is very sad, but beautiful. One wonders how long Harry has left, will he be lonely and will he get to say his goodbyes? Also one gets annoyed at Mr Hauer for not getting involved in more work of this caliber. Lets hope he continues to do fine work in Holland and stays away from Hollywood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth Watching&#34;
b&#39;&#34;Campfire Tales&#34; is basically made up of three spooky stories that a group of friends tell after they get into a car crash in the woods after a concert. The film begins with the classic &#34;Hook&#34; story, and then we\&#39;re introduced to the group of friends driving home from the concert. They crash their car, put out some flares, and start a fire in a little abandoned chapel, waiting for someone to arrive with help as they warm themselves by the fire. To pass the time, they decide to start telling classic horror stories, about terrorized honeymooners, a girl who falls prey to an Internet predator, and a motorist who takes refuge in a haunted house. As they tell the eerie tales, each story becomes increasingly terrifying, but the real shock that awaits them is yet to come...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, the last story they tell is probably the scariest and had some genuine, frightening effects. The first story was alright, and the motorhome sequence near the end was a little creepy. The second story built a lot of suspense, more than either of the others did, but it\&#39;s unoriginal plot was it\&#39;s downfall. I remember watching this movie a long time ago when I was like eight years old on HBO and the third story scared the crap out of me, although it\&#39;s not scary to me now. You\&#39;ll probably recognize some of the cast here, particularly Amy Smart from the opening &#34;hook&#34; interlude story, and Christine Taylor as one of the main actresses in the film. The twist ending was kinda interesting too, I know I didn\&#39;t see that coming, I thought it was all cleverly pieced together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum things up, if you\&#39;re looking for a horror movie that is worth the while, rent this, you should be happy. It\&#39;s a great anthology of some classic urban legends, and the whole film was tied together neatly. It is much better than what one would expect. 7/10.&#39;
b&#34;Wonderful movie. Adult content. Lots of erotic scenes plus excellent music and dance scenes. My wife and I absolutely loved this movie and wish they&#39;d make more like it.&#34;
b&#39;taking into consideration the Chan films that would follow, this isn\&#39;t bad. Plenty of stereotypes beginning with the Black man in the beginning and when the police captain orders that &#34;every Hindu in town&#34; by rounded-up. A parade of stereotypical characters enter the scene including Shemp of the Three Stooges. Charlie seems to move quickly around the city going from Sutton Pl. to the W. Village in a flash.The ending is silly. An obvious toy airplane is used as it climbs through the sky and then nose dives. Ed Wood couldn\&#39;t have done it better. The final scene is absurd as the murderer will obviously incriminate himself in his attempt to quiet the one person who knows his identity. Overall, it is worth watching.&#39;
b&#39;A film, first and foremost, should be good storytelling. It should be entertaining - and entertaining doesn\&#39;t necessarily mean &#34;laughs&#34;, and it doesn\&#39;t necessarily mean &#34;light&#34;. It basically means you\&#39;re not bored while watching it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As brilliant as 2001 may be, it is a difficult film to watch, especially for the current (video-game-playing/iPod fumbling) generation. Its slow pace and the sometimes intolerable amount of time it takes for an actor to perform a single action (e.g. the attempt to rescue the crew member floating in space) will stretch your patience. On the other hand, the cinematography is brilliant, the film cleverly directed, the ending thought-provoking and the score...the score is chilling, especially as the crew in the transporter approaches the artifact on the moon. Boy, I had goose bumps, big time. This doesn\&#39;t happen often when I watch films, and is a testament to Kubrick\&#39;s directing skills. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It IS considered a classic, and many people consider it the best science-fiction film of all time. That alone is a good reason to watch it if you haven\&#39;t done so yet. However, just because everybody else thinks it\&#39;s a brilliant film doesn\&#39;t mean you have to force yourself to like it. You either will (like it) or you won\&#39;t. Perhaps the slow pace isn\&#39;t such a bad thing, after all. Directing your attention to something rather static and slow-paced for 2 1/2 hours might teach you a lesson. It will certainly be a different experience to all these fast-moving, fast-paced images we are subjected to these days (whether commercials, music videos or video games). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I myself think it\&#39;s a &#34;memorable&#34; film. But not one I\&#39;m eager to watch again anytime soon (unless I\&#39;m in a particular mood for slow-paced films). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hence, 7 stars out of 10 from me.&#39;
b&#34;I first played this around 98&#39; or 99&#39; when I was with my friends.I thought the game was really great,and loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The game is simple.On one player mode,you go around as James Bond and complete missions in different places like an Arctic wasteland or a city.My favorite was one with a tank.On two player mode,you and a friend choose from any character you wish and go all out with a fight.Through out the area you are in,you will find ammo and weapons to help.From hand guns to rifles to lasers and even your fists work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again with player two mode,there are lots of places to go,and some to unlock.I find this game really fun,but also very suspenseful.Because,you never really know where your opponent is,and it&#39;s surprising to see them behind a door where you are going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This game gets ****(1/2) stars or of ***** Very good!Go play it sometime!&#34;
b&#39;This is such a revered and studied film, a classic among Hitchcock\&#39;s many, it takes no cajoling to want to watch it again. Yet you think: can it hold up even when the huge (and clever, and amazing) trick of the plot is no surprise?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And for starters there is the start, a profoundly beautiful and slick telling of the really the whole story, the gist of it. Two taxis, two men shown with their shoes, each walking onto the train, sitting then across from each other, and, oops, a mistake, a little nudge, and the conversation begins, and we see the men themselves. They are interchangeable. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tone here is characteristic of Hitchcock, as it is in many horror and suspense films-- cheery and light. We know entering the film, however, that this won\&#39;t be the case, so already we are worried. What, after all, is about to go wrong?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot. In truly Hitchcock fashion, it is a purely innocent man (nearly always a man) who faces injustice, who is trapped by circumstance threatening what is most valuable to him. The innocent in this case, tennis player Guy Haynes, is played with an innocence that is believable--his collegiate politeness in that first scene, for example, as he realizes the other man is a little cuckoo, is just what you or I might do. The not-so-innocent man is the self- absorbed and scarily intelligent spoiled child, Bruno Anthony, played with utter brilliance by Robert Walker. (This uncanny performance is equivalent to that of another Hitchcock wacko, played by Anthony Perkins in Psycho.) So from scene one, on the train (and the train, really gorgeous!), we have the two leads and we have the mind-blowing and utterly simple and ultimately devastating plot, from the first novel by Patricia Highsmith, who also wrote the books behind the two Mr. Ripley movies. And it doesn\&#39;t hurt that the screenplay was co- written by Raymond Chandler himself, who knows something about economy and clever dialog. And crime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And of course there is more than just the first scene. What to note? Well, that smarty of a senator\&#39;s daughter (I thought she was terrific) is Hitchcock\&#39;s daughter, Patricia, who is still with us (as of 2009; she also had a role in Psycho). And there is a characteristic landmark location for a key scene in the film--the tennis courts in the Hamptons, known to us as the site of the U.S. Open. The fantastic last full scene with the carousel is the only place where Hitchcock moves into a kind of slow and steady montage, building up the suspense by making it surreal. The fear gets positively fattening with the laughing children and the old man crawling underneath it all. And when it collapses in a crash--that\&#39;s all backprojected on a set, one of the more naturalistic uses by a director known for not worrying about the realism of his back projections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The photography is that perfect Hollywood stunning without becoming so stylized (as in some noir films) that it is an object in its own right. Look again at the first scene, or the shooting (and editing) of Haynes entering the house for what the audience thinks is a murder. This is sophisticated construction. When we are not completely surprised that it\&#39;s Bruno in the bed, that only proves that the director has us on our toes. Something unexpected is always expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are there glitches? Who knows? It depends on what kind of falseness you can accept (or embrace) as beautiful style. The scene where Bruno is choking the old woman at a party is both brilliant (the woman, played by Norma Varden, is a caricature so believable it takes your breath away) and marred by his looking at the senator\&#39;s daughter and being triggered into a deadly trance by her glasses, and her resemblance to his earlier victim. This is a mid-20th Century idea of psychology that intrudes on many of Hitchcock\&#39;s efforts. (The end of Psycho, for starters.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Wikipedia article on the film smartly emphasizes the consistent doubling of things in the movie, from the main characters to the murder victim and the senator\&#39;s daughter. This echoes in lots of little ways--two men trail him to the tennis court, two men accompany the victim to the amusement park, and so on. There can be too much made of this, but it does supply an aesthetic consistency above and below our consciousness. Don\&#39;t forget, there are meant to be two murders--it is the lack of the second murder, the inability to create a doubling in that case, that causes Bruno to unravel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Walker the actor had emotional problems and was institutionalized in the year before this movie was shot, and just afterwards, he died from a reaction to a drug used to calm one of his outbursts. Though he appeared in other films, Strangers on a Train is easily his tour-de- force. Farley Granger had a long career that never quite saw him break into true stardom, though his style can have a peculiar nervous sweetness that really works, especially in They Live by Night. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if you watch this one for the first or third time, do look for the chilling and hilarious scene at the tennis match where the crowd\&#39;s heads all move back and forth in unison-- except for Bruno\&#39;s. He is staring out without moving his head straight at us. As the trailer for the movie says, after this movie, you won\&#39;t be talking to &#34;strangers on a train.&#34;&#39;
b&#34;Although it might seem a bit bizarre to see a 32-year-old woman play the part of a 12-year-old, Mary Pickford soon makes you forget the incongruities and simply enjoy the fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mary is a street kid in New York City, with her own lovable gang of mischief makers, whose attentions are engaged by the older William Haines (he was 25 at the time &amp; just on the cusp of his own screen stardom.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To give away too much of the plot would not be fair. Suffice it that Mary is great fun to watch &amp; amply displays why she was Hollywood&#39;s first and most beloved super star. Production values are very good, with lots of extras making the NYC street scenes quite believable.&#34;
b&#39;Thank goodness for the Coen Brothers. Their success has brought them bigger budgets,but hasn\&#39;t rid them of their creativity. I had planned on seeing another movie, but it was sold out so I went to this one instead. By the time it began, I had forgotten what movie I was there to see. I was surprised in more ways than one. This movie is hilarious, but they don\&#39;t make any cheap jokes just to get the laughs. The writing is brilliant, and delivered with great skill by George Clooney (after this, nobody can say he\&#39;s just a pretty face) and the rest of the cast. It can be appreciated on many levels, whether you remember the Odyssey or not. I can\&#39;t remember the last time I saw a movie that was this clever. I\&#39;ve seen others I would describe as beautiful, intriguing, funny and charming, all of which also describe &#34;Oh Brother,&#34; but this movie reminded me of older seinfeld episodes where all the subplots came together in the end. You can feel that their journey is building up to something, but you can\&#39;t tell what. And the Coen brothers do not fail us, the end is certainly not disappointing. It\&#39;s surprising, and ties up all the loose ends neatly, without wearing the story out.&#39;
b&#34;Wladyslaw Starewicz was a Russian-born animator living in France who did incredible things using stop-motion. I&#39;ve seen a couple of these films before and they feature his favorite subjects--insects, frogs and various animals. They are extremely realistic and lifelike and even today are amazing to watch--the quality is simply fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one stars lots and lots of frogs. They appeal to their god, Jupiter, to give them a king. Why do they need a king, wonders Jupiter--their lives are perfectly fine now. So, to teach them a nasty lesson, he makes an Egret the king and one by one it starts eating its subjects! Then, the frogs once again appeal to Jupiter, who states the obvious moral that it&#39;s best to be happy with what you have! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the animation quality is incredible, this is a very creepy film for kids. I would think this would terrify them both by how real the animals look as well as the story itself which is not for the faint of heart!&#34;
b&#39;Lead actor Yuko Tanaka fulfills so much in the exceptionally meditative &#34;The Milkwoman,&#34; a tranquil canvass on missed chances in the life of a 50-something woman, charting her routine with sincerely poignant motives. Played out in the picturesque, tranquil town of Nagasaki, Akira Ogata\&#39;s unconventional romantic film, so to speak, is less a straight-out melodrama than a deliberate introspection of its characters\&#39; surrender to their current lives as a result of a tragic past that forced them to a choice they did not call for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfectly embodying the requisite world-weariness subjected to a spiritless routine, Tanaka plays Minako Oba, a middle-aged woman who, before her work shift at a supermarket, takes it upon herself to deliver bottles of milk among the residents of the hilly Nagasaki. One of the houses she constantly passes by to make such a delivery is that of Kaita Takanashi (Ittoku Kishibe), a local government employee caring for her terminally ill wife (Akiko Nishina). Minako and Kaita were high school sweethearts who, courtesy of an ignominious event concerning their parents, separated ways since then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Opening his film with the foreboding narration of a young Minako vowing never to leave Nagasaki, Ogata does as such with the narrative, patiently sticking with Minako as he, deftly aided by Tanako\&#39;s understated yet highly effective performance, follows her -- whether she\&#39;s having chitchat with her aunt (Misako Watanabe) on being single, or when she jogs up and down the countless footsteps of their hilly town to distribute milk -- as she and Kaita gradually overcome the hindrances that kept them apart for years. Such unhurried development may not suit viewers weaned on fast-paced narratives but for the rest, it\&#39;s a heartfelt introspection that affects powerfully and emphatically.&#39;
b&#39;if you are dating a girl that is into wicca!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;many parts of this movie were killer and the feeling you get from this movie while watching it and immediately after is enough alone to sit through it all but some things really bothered me about this film that i cant really put my finger on...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i definitely think that this movie is one that any art student or photography student should see b/c of the camera style and graininess that ive never seen but that is just it...it looks like an art student made it and the plot if there is any is so jumpy that you really need to be on a lot of drugs to get just what is going on&#39;
b&#34;Just watched this one again. I wanted to show it to one of my friends and we had the best time. This is why these kind of movies are made, to entertain people and Zombie Bloodbath 2 does that for me and for everyone I have showed it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story concerns a group of teenagers in a van that run into a group of escaped convicts who have taken over an old farmhouse. When a scarecrow (that is actually a demon I think) gets disturbed, it comes to life and re-animates dead bodies from the local cemeteries. This leads our heroes to escape only to land in the arms of two insane killers that are in the process of torturing some people in a deli in a small town. Pretty soon it&#39;s a showdown with humans fighting zombies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved this movie! From it&#39;s different formats (black and white film, video and digital cameras) to the very fast pace and great music, there was always something going on and it NEVER bores you! Sure, it&#39;s cheap, but you can tell that a great deal of care and hard work went into this film. I have read other reviews and all I can say is that these people have missed the point. If you want 35mm Full Moon fluff, or if you are into modern stuff like Urban Legend, then I say pass on this. If you like low budget stuff like Gates Of Hell and Evil Dead, I say buy this now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The make-up and gore is very good, the acting is uneven at times, but over-all it is pretty good and the editing is very impressive. There is enough going on in this one to fill two more films! It is actually one of the better b-movies I have seen in ages.&#34;
b&#39;I finally got a chance to settle in and compare the two versions of this film currently going around -- First, the good old scummy, sleazy Embassy VHS print called SCREAMERS, and then a new fully restored Italian DVD by everyone\&#39;s new favorite media company, No Shame of Italy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The American adverts about &#34;men turned inside out&#34; is as everyone says, totally misleading, and indicative of a Roger Cormanized take on what otherwise would be a superior fantasy-adventure thriller for grown ups. The complete Italian version is a somewhat sprawling, well designed and deliberately paced take on &#34;Island of Dr. Moreau&#34;, and there\&#39;s nothing wrong with that. It\&#39;s a sumptuous, handsome Euro Horror outing with a brain, good plotting, character development, location shooting, period costuming and sets, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I must admit that the 14 year old knucklehead weed puffer still lurking somewhere inside of me got a bigger kick out of the more lurid, sleazy and unkempt Roger Corman version, which has some nice over the top gore, a flashy but preposterous opening segment, and then the bulk of Martino\&#39;s original film, albeit somewhat abridged to make room for Roger\&#39;s idea of entertainment. The pacing was somewhat quicker, the shock sequences closer together, and you see just as much of Ms. Bach\&#39;s fantastic form as you do in the extended Italian version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still don\&#39;t have much of an idea about what the specific story concerns though: there are a number of plot twists and incidental characters that were somewhat hard to keep track of. A local voodoo subplot didn\&#39;t help much, and it\&#39;s funny how everything culminates in just another fistfight between the noble castaway prisoner and the mad scientist ... Perhaps a few more viewings are in order. I will say this: Fans of the movie should avail themselves of one of these PAL imports and take a look at what is actually a movie rather than just another murky old home video -- the widescreen shot compositions once again reveal that Martino had an eye for filling his screen with interesting stuff. Nobody gets their heads ripped off like in the SCREAMERS print, but it\&#39;s still interesting stuff, and once again proof that while his standards may have been pretty much confined to the area around the gutter, Roger Corman new good trashy fun when he had it made for him, and side by side these are actually better movies than they had to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7/10&#39;
b&#39;&#34;Don\&#39;t Change Your Husband&#34; is another soap opera comedy from Producer/Director Cecil B. De Mille. It is notable as the first of several films he made starring Gloria Swanson. I guess you could also call it a sequel of sorts to his &#34;Old Wives For New&#34; (1918).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;James (Elliot Dexter) and Leila (Swanson) Porter are a forty-ish couple where James has gone to seed and become slovenly and lazy. he has a penchant for smelly cigars and eating raw onions. He takes his wife for granted. Leila tries to get him to straighten out to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One night at a dinner party at the Porters, Leila meets the dashing Schyler Van Sutphen (now there\&#39;s a moniker), the playboy nephew of socialite Mrs. Huckney (Sylvia Ashton). She invites Leila to her home for the weekend to make James &#34;miss her&#34;. Once there Schyler begins to put the moves on her, promising her pleasure, wealth and love, if she will leave her husband and go with him. The sequences involving Leila\&#39;s imagining this promised new life are lavishly staged and forecast De Mille\&#39;s epic costume drams later in his career.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leila, bored with her marriage and her disinterested husband, divorces James and marries the playboy. James ultimately realizes that he has lost the only thing that mattered to him and begins to mend his ways. He shaves off his mustache, works out, shuns onions and re-acquires some manners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, all is not rosy with Leila\&#39;s new marriage. Schyler it seems likes to gamble and has taken up with the gold digging Nanette (aka Tootsie, or some such name) (Julia Faye). Schyler loses all of his money and steals Leila\&#39;s diamond ring to cover his losses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One fateful day, Leila meets the &#34;new&#34; James and is taken by the changes in him. James drives her home and becomes aware of her situation and.................................................&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film marked the beginning of Gloria Swanson\&#39;s rise to super stardom in a career that would rival that of Mary Pickford. Barely 20 years of age, she had begun her career in Mack Sennett two reel comedies as a teen ager. Elliot Dexter was almost 50 at this time but he and Swanson make a good team, although it\&#39;s hard to imagine anyone tiring of the lovely Miss Swanson as is the case in this film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dexter and Sylvia Ashton had appeared in the similar &#34;Old Wives For New&#34; where the wife had gone to seed and the husband was wronged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also in the cast are De Mille regulars Theodore Roberts as a bishop and Raymond Hatton as a gambler.&#39;
b&#34;This is definitely Nolan&#39;s most intimite,and thought-provoking piece. Not to say that Memento or Insomnia are bad,but they were definitely up to more Hollywood standards...while Following is more of an indie flick. The story is very brilliant,and very well developed. Overall...watch this if your a fan of any of Nolan&#39;s work,I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be able to appreciate it more.&#34;
b&#39;A young Korean artist lives in Amsterdam. She is a bit of a loner and has never had a serious relationship, insisting that she is &#34;waiting&#34; for the right person. She works in the public square, drawing portraits for passersby but, for herself, she also indulges in painting her favorite flowers, daisies. But, all of a sudden, she has a secret admirer. Flowers are delivered to her residence every day at 4:15, usually daisies, yet she can not catch the sender in the act. This is because, unknown to her, her beau is a Korean hit-man, and he wishes to remain hidden, for now. One day in the square, however, another attractive Korean man sits for the artist and happens to be carrying a pot of daisies. She concludes that he is her shy hero and, also, the man she has been waiting to find. This second gentleman, too, has a secret; he is an Interpol agent. The assassin can see everything that transpires in the square, due to having an apartment close by. Naturally, he is disturbed that another man has entered the young girl\&#39;s life. How will this shadowy love triangle play out? This is a beautiful picture to watch. The setting in Amsterdam and the surrounding countryside is very, very lovely. Add in three most attractive young Korean actors and, visually, any viewer has a stunning panorama in front of them. The story is quite nice, too, being a mixture of drama and action, with a dash of the unexpected. Costumes are very fetching and the production values, high. In short, anyone searching for a quality foreign film with a compelling story and great scenery would find this movie a wonderful choice for a diverting evening. Should you have someone\&#39;s hand to hold during the view, so much the better.&#39;
b&#39;Marco Poloni (Costas Mandylor) was born into a baking family in the Bronx. Although the Polonis have been well known for their confections over the decades, the business has fallen on hard times. Meanwhile, Grace Carpenter (Lauren Holly) is a most talented dessert maker in Manhattan but, she can not seem to land a prime confectionery position because of the glass ceiling. An accidental meeting between Marco and Grace results in a conversation about a possible solution for them both. There is a high profile bake-off, The Golden Whisk, taking place in the near future and Marco wants Grace to partner with him. There is a hefty amount of &#34;dough&#34;, haha, at stake for the winners, enough to set Grace up in her own business and save the Polonis eatery, too. Reluctantly, Grace agrees. But, there are complications. Some of the judges and fellow contestants may have past issues with both Grace and Marco. Then, too, although Marco and Grace both feel some sort of attraction for the other, Grace has a long standing, very rich boyfriend. Can Marco and Grace win the contest? This is a lovely film for the romantic at heart. First, there is the nice cast. Holly has always been a lovely actress with a notable husky voice that furthers her attractions. In this film, she is perfectly cast as the determined but beautiful Grace. Mandylor, a newcomer, delights, too as the good-looking rival baker. The rest of the actors, including the wonderful Brenda Vaccaro as Marco\&#39;s mother, is quite nice. As a Hallmark movie, the costumes, sets, and production amenities are beyond reproach and the script still manages to seem fresh and funny, despite some familiar themes. Treat yourself, romcom lovers, to a most sweet confection by securing a viewing of this film. It is definitely the movie equivalent of a big box of quality chocolates.&#39;
b&#39;This film is a refreshing change of pace from the mindless Hong Kong triad movies I have grown so tired of. There are no spectacular gun fights. No car chases. And practically minimal action to speak of. The audience is kept in suspense for the most part, though certain aspects of the so called &#34;ploy&#34; by Andy Lau are quite obvious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film has been hailed as a departure from the genre of violent triad films, and as an &#34;intelligent&#34; crime film. To an extent, it is. But, to some extent, it still fails the &#34;believability&#34; test. One can hardly picture any triad member to be dumb enough to not see through the female disguise of Andy Lau in a second. It also seemed to have fallen for the &#34;if someone was seriously ill, the said someone will be coughing up copious amounts of blood regularly&#34; thing Chinese films seem to go for all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The subtle relationship between the two lead characters is a refreshing change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all an enjoyable film, even though the concept is not new and there are few surprises. &gt;&#39;
b&#39;In &#34;The Squire of Gothos&#34;, Kirk and his crew encounter a powerful super-being, who keeps the Captain, &#34;Bones&#34; and a few crewmembers captive for no apparent reason. I could be wrong, but I think this is the first Star Trek episode I ever saw and the program that made me hungry for more. It is not one of the best episodes, but the rock-solid premise of an alien being who putting the Enterprise\&#39;s crew in a corner, is the kind of situation that makes the show so much fun to watch. In a way, the super-humanoid anticipates one of Star Trek\&#39;s most famous characters, Next Generation\&#39;s enigmatic &#34;Q&#34;. This episode is also memorable for creating a unique situation: it is the first time Uhura is part of the action and the story allows the viewer to see what an endearing character Uhuara can be when the story allows her. Too bad the show never fully explored this iconic figure.&#39;
b&#34;I like Dylan Moran from his work in Black Books, although I found some of his stand-up to be really indulgent in terms of long confused gaps... however I was intrigued to see this film starring he and Michael Caine and curiosity got the better of me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was stunned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dylan&#39;s vocal range and characterisation of the different people he was playing in the film was absolutely perfect, something beyond the skills of a mere stand-up comedian and really truly on a par with alec guinness, john hurt and the other greats- truly he was skilled in his portrayal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michael Caine was a very convincing prima donna and the standard british film device of having a precocious child on hand to be overly wise and withering worked- the only aspect I didn&#39;t really like was the unbelieveable plot feature of the chemistry between Dolores and the cockney gangsta&#39;s hard man played by Dylan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it was great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the non-cop-out ending where it did end up happily ever after, but with MC getting a beating. OK, it&#39;s not exactly being strung up by your goolies and beijng disembowelled (which is what a real crime boss would do to you if you nicked \xc2\xa350k off them) but it showed at least a small measure of reality in the story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the film, and I would recommend it to anyone- but- I would also warn them not to turn it off after 15 minutes because it started a bit slow. If you stick it out, then it will all come back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And with regards to the swearing- well, they&#39;re in Ireland. It wouldn&#39;t be real otherwise.&#34;
b&#39;This movie was amazing!!!! From beginning to end, the movie is packed with fun, laughs, music, enjoyable rock music, hot chicks, more music, action, drama, and the f-bomb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although some scenes are entirely bizarre and unfitting, they were fun to watch and enjoyable. All in all this movie left you feeling great and happy. Especially those that love rock music.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soundtrack is great, the laughs are plentiful, and the storyline is simple, entertaining, yet complex. You have to see this movie if you love rock music!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall Vote: 10 out of 10!&#39;
b&#39;It\&#39;s been a long time since such an original, quite funny, black comedy has surfaced. If &#34;Eating Raoul&#34; is on your top 100 list, do yourself a favor and find &#34;Undertaking Betty&#34; immediately. The subject of death being funny has been attempted before (see Paul Bartel and Mary Woronov in &#34;Mortuary Academy&#34;). While that movie has some brilliant moments of black comedy, &#34;Undertaking Betty&#34; is much more steady, with a better cast. Who could imagine that the undertaking business might be fertile ground for an original, uplifting, and heartfelt comedy? I was surprised and you will be too. I highly recommend seeing &#34;Undertaking Betty&#34; - MERK&#39;
b&#39;When the episode was made and aired Eisenhower was President. Kennedy was President-Elect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the episode, it was a passable episode, if not a bit earnest. &#34;The Professor&#34; shows not much range here, and the whole thing seems a little rushed (a lot of episodes of the TZ seem to not fit the time slot, some seeming like they\&#39;re crammed in and rushed, some with little or nothing to it spread out over the half hour, and some, of course fit). I guess you just expect a little more tension than to be taken back to some rooms and drugged. But overall a decent episode. Indeed the &#34;what if&#34; motif of time travel is a nugget in itself and sets the table of with basic interest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7 out of 10, considering there were a lot of TZ episodes not quite as good, and some a great deal better.&#39;
b&#34;A somewhat typical bit of filmmaking from this era. Obviously, It was first conceived into this world for the stage, but nonetheless a very good film from beginning to end. Peter O&#39;Toole and Susannah York get to do their stage performance act for the silver screen and both do it effectively. There is very little in the way of story and anyone not familiar with this type of off beat character study may be a little put off by it. All in all, though, A good film in which Peter O&#39;Toole and Susannah York get to overact.&#34;
b&#39;I can honestly say that &#34;Death Bed: The Bed That Eats&#34; was a much better movie than I expected. Allow me to clarify the plot in case the title of the film is a little too vague - there is a bed that eats. An evil bed. It eats people. Several unsuspecting women on an &#34;outing&#34; of some kind, stumble across the sinister &#34;sack&#34; and ultimately fall prey to it\&#39;s hunger. The bed\&#39;s devouring process consists of a yellow foam soaking people into it\&#39;s inner... stomach acid; all complete with chewing sounds. This is a very strange cult flick and the only film from George Barry who had forgotten he made it until word-of-mouth of it\&#39;s newfound cult status got back to him and he decided to release it on DVD. Not a bad movie at all, if you can look past the lousy acting and enjoy the hokey effects - the most laughable being the guy whose hands are eaten off and he is left with only plastic looking skeletal fingers... Pretty dreamlike tone to it, too, coming across as very surreal and aberrant - mainly the whole thing involving the artist behind the painting and the demonic back story of the bed. If you like bizarre no-budget, oddball flicks than definitely seek out &#34;Death Bed&#34;.&#39;
b&#39;I would not compare it to Le Placard, which IMHO had more comic moments, but Romuald &amp; Juliette while being a slow starter certainly kept your attention going throughout the film, nicely paced and reaching a heart warming conclusion :) There were many marvellous comedic moments, some brilliant pathos and realistic situation acting by all actors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a typically French film, in which while confronting prejudices and phobias, which in turn the made the viewer confront his own shortcomings! I am certainly pleased to have this in my library, and will no doubt watch it time and time again, which to me is a mark of a great film.&#39;
b&#39;Some martial-arts purists think that comedy was the worst thing that could have happened to the old-school kung-fu flick; and it is true that the introduction of comedy into the genre signaled the end of the &#34;chop-socky&#34; period in Hong Kong film. But the fact is, one can only carry-on a primarily physical exhibition of prowess for just so long, then everyone gets bored with it. And that\&#39;s really why the chop-socky died and how the Hong Kong &#34;New Wave&#34; action film was born: the producers, the actors, the directors all just got bored with hitting people for ninety-minutes straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given that, and given the fact that Liu Chia Liang is a professional director with a considerable list of films in his resume, this film has to be seen as something other than just another kung-fu comedy. Rather, it is a comic film within the martial-arts genre, and in fact one of the best ever made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What Liu has done with this film is really a pleasant surprise: he has taken a martial-arts plot and re-constructed it along the lines of a Hollywood-style musical! Complete with episodes of singing and dancing! It was around the time of the making of this film that some film-makers and film fans began to recognize that the cinematic performance of martial-arts (really derived from the acrobatics of the Chinese opera) has more in common with dance than with fighting. (I will continue to point out this connection until most Americans realize what they are actually supposed to look for when watching a martial arts film - well-choreographed body movements, using the plot of an action film as an excuse for their performance.) At any rate, quite clearly Liu Chia Liang made this connection and decided he would explore it close to its limits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result is an incredibly charming entertainment, filled with marvelously human characters attempting miraculous kung-fu (and tripping over their own shoelaces as often as not when they do so). and the film being set at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, allows Liu the opportunity to explore the nature of the Westernization and Modernization of China that contributed so greatly to the making of the China we know today. So the film has considerable historical import as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, fans of Stephen Chow\&#39;s recent Kung Fu Hustle should really watch this movie carefully, as Chow clearly learned from it before the making of his own film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A very amusing, well-made film. Oh, yes, and the kung fu in it is really, really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purists won\&#39;t admit it, but this is probably director Liu\&#39;s best film.&#39;
b&#34;Mullholland Drive proves once again that David Lynch is the Master of cinematic expression. At the screening last night I witnessed a brilliant addition to the history of cinema. The performances are astounding, the score entrancing, and the photography mesmerizing. David&#39;s ability to weave the many elements of film making into a unique and stunning cinematic experience is unequalled. As I watched Mullholland Drive I couldn&#39;t help but realize that with David Lynch in this world we are truly blessed. The cinema is blessed as well for, in the films of David Lynch, we are shown that one man&#39;s vision can be realized with stunning results. We realize that blockbusters are not the only path. We realize that a true cinematic artist has a chance in this world and in that we are blessed indeed.&#34;
b&#39;I have seen a number of horror movies to know that this one was one of kind. Full Moon Pictures has a knack of giving this fan an entertaining night. For all the cheesiness of most vampire films, This Is the ONE that has not only a good premise but has two good sequels. A Must See.&#39;
b&#39;&#34;The Love Letter&#34; is a somewhat pleasant, very very low-key romantic comedy in which the use of just the right few words in a mysterious love letter unlocks the secret passions and longings of a sleepy sea-side town\&#39;s inhabitants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s not for all audiences. &#34;The Love Letter&#34;, I feel, benefits from it\&#39;s simple and quiet tone. Never intentionally wacky and phony like most romantic comedies it\&#39;s quaint, picturesque, and comfy. However, for these exact same reasons, many viewers will be bored and disinterested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cast is nice. It\&#39;s great to see Tom Selleck again, and is such an underplayed role. And it\&#39;s hard to believe this is the same Kate Capshaw we met 15 years ago in &#34;Indiana Jones and the Temple Of Doom&#34;. She\&#39;s quite naturally good here; improving in every role I\&#39;ve seen her in since grating on Indy\&#39;s nerves. And is it possible Capshaw is just getting lovelier and lovelier with age ? ( What is it about that Spielberg!?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn\&#39;t amount to much; but after another noisy summer movie season I\&#39;ll probably look back with brief fondness for this light-as-a-feather romance.&#39;
b&#34;The late Director John Frankenheimer directed his first feature film, The Young Stranger, after starting out directing live television dramas in New York City. This film came on the heels of the success of Rebel Without A Cause in 1955. James MacArthur made his feature film debut as a troubled teen with a movie producer father, played by James Daly, who doesn&#39;t establish enough of a relationship with his son. Kim Hunter plays the mother, who tries to bridge the gap between her husband and her son. The film uses the popular juvenile delinquent angle of the time to tell its story. MacArthur gets in trouble at a movie theater with an overzealous theater manager played by Whit Bissell. MacArthur, in turn, has to deal with a police sergeant, James Gregory, bent on teaching him a lesson. The material could easily have turned exploitative, laughable, and sensational, like any number of others of the period did. However, under the sure-handed direction of Frankenheimer, the film is a sensitive portrayal of teenage and parental dynamics. The dialog is realistic and most of the scenes hold up surprisingly well. Some of the scenes with Bissell, as the theater manager, and Gregory, as the police sergeant, are a bit heavy-handed and dated. The performances are uniformly good though, which is necessary for a film of this nature and about this topic to succeed. This is an impressive feature film debut both for MacArthur and Frankenheimer. *** of 4 stars.&#34;
b&#39;Send them to the freezer. This is the solution two butchers find after they discover the popularity of selling human flesh. An incredible story with humor and possible allegories that make it much more than a horror film. The complex characters defy superficial classification and make the story intriguing and worthwhile - if you can stand it. Definitely a dark film but also a bit redemptive.&#39;
b&#39;Begotten.The magic.The Terror.The slight boredom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That &#34;Begotten&#34; is for acquired tastes goes without saying,you don\&#39;t just happen to watch it unless your friends are real art-house movie buffs.You must dig the weird,the macabre,the bizarre.You must dig cool flicks.And you must dig to find diamonds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Begotten&#34; is one of the most visually dazzling and mystifying films ever known to man.The visual part is something to behold,something no one can prepare you for.But since the film is devoid of any type of dialogue,the visual part is pretty much the only part....&#34;Begotten&#34; is a visual film.The soundscapes created for the film are magical and groundbreaking but still....the sight of it....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;God commits suicide in a particularly gory scene then from his corpse rises Mother Earth who impregnates herself with God\&#39;s semen and gives birth to Flesh on Bone,a retarded child.She then abandons him,and he gets tortured by heathen-like creatures.Mother comes back (to save him?) but she and her son get murdered by the horrible creatures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film is about the meaninglessness of life,and about the fact that we come to this planet to suffer and to die,and that when something dies something else is born etc.Nihilism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film\&#39;s no.1 quality is of course the visuals,the setting,those haunting images,this other-worldly quality....After you\&#39;re done watching,you feel like an alien.It\&#39;s THAT mesmerizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When people say it should last 30\&#39; instead of 70\&#39; they\&#39;re right.No they\&#39;re not,it could last 40\&#39;.It\&#39;s just that everything happens to such a slow pace.In fact,the plot summary I provided is all that happens in the film,like no kidding.Still,it\&#39;s....I don\&#39;t know....Glorious... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...Like a flame burning away the darkness...&#39;
b&#39;This film grabbed me right from its start, where a sweet-looking teen-aged girl is shown visiting a grave alone, then Elton John\&#39;s powerful song &#34;Friends&#34; starts playing while she\&#39;s shown walking alone through the streets of Paris, carrying a suitcase, naively unaware of the car theft and prostitution going on around her. The entire film is a beautiful, dreamy, romantic collection of scenes of young love, holding hands, living in the country, wild horses running around freely, fields of wildflowers, sunsets, toasts of wine, evenings by the fireside, having fun, and general innocence, all set to romantic music by Elton John. It\&#39;s magical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somehow I missed seeing this film when I was growing up. I\&#39;m sure it would have left a strong impression on me if I had seen it then. I remember the radio advertisement for the movie in 1971, talking about how it was a special movie with music by Elton John, and with the chorus of the theme song &#34;Friends&#34; playing in the ad (&#34;Makin\&#39; friends for the world to see...&#34;), but I never heard anything else about it in those days, and never got to see it until I rented it 35 years later from a video store. By then it had been edited, censored, and all kinds of unhappy people with angry political agendas were using all kinds of ugly words to describe the film. What can I say? The world has gone insane since then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story is that a 14-year-old girl is forced to move in with her cousin in Paris after both her parents die. (It was their grave she was visiting in the opening scene.) One day while visiting the zoo alone she meets a 15-year-old boy, they hit it off, and agree to meet the next day. The next day while riding together the boy accidentally drives his car into a lake in a freakish solo car accident. It was his father\&#39;s car, he can\&#39;t bear to go back home to face his father\&#39;s wrath, so the two teenagers begin living in the French countryside together, with the mutual background that they both hated their lives at home. They settle into an unoccupied cottage, the boy takes odd jobs to support themselves, their supposed friendship turns into romance, the girl becomes pregnant, and they successfully have a baby at home. All the while the boy\&#39;s father has the police attempting to locate his missing son. On the 1-year anniversary of the couple\&#39;s flight together, the police finally locate the boy\&#39;s employer by an in-person inquiry, and are told they can see the boy the next morning when he comes to work. The next morning the boy is shown leaving his cottage to go to work, saying a sweet farewell to his girlfriend/wife, and happily doing cartwheels as the scene freezes on his girlfriend waving goodbye. At least that\&#39;s how the video version I saw ends. It\&#39;s an unexpected though well-timed ending, presumably depicting the last moments of bliss before the boy is taken back to his parents\&#39; home and his happy life with his wife and baby is shattered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As beautiful as the story and images are, the plot is awfully unrealistic and highly contrived. I think it\&#39;s better just to enjoy the movie as a young person\&#39;s dream-come-true fantasy and to go no further in analysis, because all logic and believability quickly fall apart when the story is examined in more depth. Why would a fully furnished and stocked cottage be left unattended with the door unlocked and unvisited for a full year? What did they plan to do when the owners returned? Why would a girl trust a car thief enough to get pregnant from him? Didn\&#39;t they think it was unethical to use other people\&#39;s homes and food? How could they ever hope to get needed dental care or other emergency medical attention while living outside of society? How could the boy have a car accident on a country road with no collision and no other cars around? Where are there places anywhere near civilization where wild horses run free? How is it that a teenage male would not have sex as the primary thing on his mind when he picks up a girl at a zoo? (The Elton John song lyrics just don\&#39;t fit.) Why would they take off clothes when sleeping outside at night when it\&#39;s about to get cold? And so on. The scenes of wild horses are contrived to appeal to girls, as is the unrealistic theme of &#34;friendship before romance,&#34; and all the back-washing and tickling scenes with their predictable outcomes, the running through flower fields towards each other, the haze filters, the scenes shot through wildflowers in the foreground, the baby ducks, and so on. It works, but it\&#39;s definitely contrived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, this is a movie about youth and freedom, and that ideal hasn\&#39;t changed since the 1970s. Young people today are still treated as belongings or as lost pets to be recovered by the police instead of treated as mature human beings who have the same needs of romantic love and freedom as does the adult world, and the ability to be responsible when given that freedom. Therefore the message is universal. It\&#39;s clear why a sequel wouldn\&#39;t work: this story is about a magical, year-long reprieve from the real world. Such a situation could never have been extended indefinitely, assuming that it could even happen in the first place, and a story about real life afterward would lack the magical appeal of such an unreal state of existence. I really hope that no teenagers took the film seriously enough to try such a foolish stunt. But I hope equally well that teenagers who were impressed by this film in the \&#39;70s learned something from it, and have since then made attempts to make such a magical world a more attainable reality for others, instead of perpetuating society\&#39;s various hatreds and repressions, especially on their own children.&#39;
b&#39;I was 19 or 20, years old at the time and living in Salt Lake City, Utah and I still remember the new dome theater, called the century 21. Layback chairs that rocked and a new sound system, large screen and huge open space between the screen and the packed theater. We felt all the excitement of a new preview screening of a film. Ta da da daa da ta da dada dada... I can still hear the opening music ringing trumpet and the crash of cymbals. I loved the interplay of characters and the filmed vistas. I know Peter Finch and Luv and Sally had some trouble with the lip-sink but hey, this was a feel good, go feel better about things film! What I regret is the way they cut the meaningful heart out of it, showed the cut version and then called it a flop. I saw the cut version and I can see it lost its view of the vision it had in the preview edition. Yes I wince a bit at Peter\&#39;s effort to make love through music but, you know I didn\&#39;t see it that way when I left the theater. when they surveyed us as we left I regret any comment I made that may have altered the original. I liked it then and still see it while I listen to the music on my LP. Most of my family has heard me sing much of the sound track and I can use the films monologues in our games of &#34;what movie is this&#34;. I wish a director\&#39;s cut on DVD was available. It is available on VHS but its not quite the same. I would particularly like a full serious lord of the rings style commentary about its origins, struggles and triumphs. Picky people should leave things well enough alone. Bring it back!!!!&#39;
b&#34;This is a great TV movie with a good story and many comic moments thanks to the excellent cast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem this movie has is that it hasn&#39;t stood the test of time as well as it might have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite this, it&#39;s definitely worth viewing, particularly if you are an Alan Alda or Ruth Gordon fan.&#34;
b&#39;This is a very funny movie. There is a self deprecating, iconoclastic tone to the movie that is very appealing. The characters are interesting. The movie flows very well and holds your interest throughout the 1 hour, 50 minutes duration of the film. The film quality is not of the highest Hollywood standards; however the original film was supposed to be made in the genre of a gritty punk-rock style. The documentary about the attempt to make the film and the subsequent betrayal of the film makers is very well detailed and easy to follow. The original film makers themselves become the main characters in the documentary version of the movie. The interviews of the film makers and the actors has been assembled in a highly entertaining story that illustrates the struggles involved in making the original film, the eventual failure of the original project and the phoenix-like rising from the ashes that evolved into this documentary film. In my mind the documentary (A Texas Tale of Treason) is a much more interesting and entertaining film than the original film (Waldos Hawiian Vacation) would have ever been. Two thumbs up for a job well done.&#39;
b&#34;This movie was well acted and kept my interest in the main character for the entire movie. Stu Unger lived an extraordinary life. Imagine if Stu were alive today! This movie paints a picture of what Stu Unger&#39;s life might have felt like. It was interesting to see how connected was growing up. I would have liked to seen more detail on Stu&#39;s partying, his gamesmanship and his relationship to Bob Stupak. But all in all, this movie was well done, well acted and the story touched on many facets of a life that was full of many events that were larger than life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie is worth renting.&#34;
b&#34;What I enjoyed most in this film was the scenery of Corfu, being Greek I adore my country and I liked the flattering director&#39;s point of view. Based on a true story during the years when Greece was struggling to stand on her own two feet through war, Nazis and hardship. An Italian soldier and a Greek girl fall in love but the times are hard and they have a lot of sacrifices to make. Nicholas Cage looking great in a uniform gives a passionate account of this unfulfilled (in the beginning) love. I adored Christian Bale playing Mandras the heroine&#39;s husband-to-be, he looks very very good as a Greek, his personality matched the one of the Greek patriot! A true fighter in there, or what! One of the movies I would like to buy and keep it in my collection...for ever!&#34;
b&#34;Caught this movie on DD while flipping channels...And thank heavens, that too when it just started.. Having studied in Pune, this film touched off many happy memories of the city...that apart, one wonders why more movies like this aren&#39;t made...Every character is so well etched-the grandpa, the kid, the doc...except for the social worker who grates a tad, the rest of the movie hardly has a flaw...a deserving entry for the Oscars, even if it wasn&#39;t nominated...definitely leaves a lump in the throat...who sez u need mush to tickle ur lacrimals ? And to think that this movie needed Sachin Tendulkar to propagate it. Inspite of being in Marathi, there was hardly a moment where I wasn&#39;t able to follow the movie...the subtitles were good.. A must watch for any fan of good cinema.&#34;
b&#34;Everything about this movie is perfect. The set design, the acting, the camera movement, the mood, the colors - everything. You&#39;ll be hard pressed to find a better movie. Easily, the best film generated in the last 35 years. Keep an eye on Michael Almereydas!!&#34;
b&#34;When I first saw this movie I was only a little kid and I fell in love with it, they really don&#39;t make movies like this anymore,I just watch this again now slightly older and still love it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Humour is perfect and fits into the movie really well, all the gags are kind of childish but will make adults laugh as well,and in a kids movie is really very rare. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Animation is amazing and to watch hand-drawn animation is a real breath of fresh air to all the computer animation we see today. The Backgrounds are stunning and the coloring is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Characters are just the kind of characters that you fall in love with the moment you start watching girls will think the Chipmunks are adorable and Guys will think the Chipettes are really kinda sexy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Songs are fun to listen too and some just really make you wanna cry or get up and dance, its also fun to watch visual humor to go along with them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Voice Acting is great no doubt even if most of the voice acting is high pitch, but an interesting thing popped up and it one of the songs from this movie but the slowed down to show the real voices behind them and its really kinda fun to watch. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you see this movie in a store or somewhere to rent I say check it out it&#39;s really worth seeing and is a perfect family movie its absolutely amazing, words can not express this movie.&#34;
b&#39;With the exception of the main character, the acting didn\&#39;t convince me, but the story was quite good: It\&#39;s about a love affair between a gay party boy and a young Mormon missionary. As you can imagine, such a relationship is quite problematic. The movie is very American and, as such, has some metaphysical undertones to counterbalance its criticism of religious intolerance. But some story lines are hilarious: one of the main characters asks his gay colleague: &#34;Do you believe in God?&#34; And he answers: &#34;\xc2\x85you mean: other than Madonna?&#34; All in all, the film is not one of my all-time favorites, but the script is really good and I really liked it: it\&#39;s entertaining and stands up against (religious) prejudice and intolerance. I think this is an important message in our times. Since I rated films that I liked less with 9, this is clearly a 10 for me. Some people may find this exaggerated, but I think this film deserves it.&#39;
b&#34;Yes, I am ashamed to admit it, but this show is positively DEVINE!!!It&#39;s so entertaining, and I have the absolute greatest time watching it.Ever since Cycle 1 it&#39;s been great, and I haven&#39;t noticed a downfall in it&#39;s glory AT ALL.Tyra Banks as you know is the host, and as fabulous as she is, there&#39;s also the other judges and co-hosts such as J. Alexander, Jay Manuel, Nigel Barker, and Twiggy.The main point of the show is for every girl invited to become America&#39;s Next Top Model, has to work their way up to the top by completing and winning photo shoot competitions.It sounds great already doesn&#39;t it, and let me tell you IT IS GREAT!!!!!It&#39;s awesome watching all the different kinds of photo shoots the girls take, and each one is different, cool, and daring.Anybody who hates this show, doesn&#39;t have a clue, and I will tell you that this show will be on for a LONG time, so DEAL WITH IT!!!&#34;
b&#34;I was truly surprised when I first saw this movie directed by Iain Softley; it differs in so much ways from the usual Hollywood mass-production. The plot itself is simple - Kevin Spacey plays a mental patient Prot who claims to be from the planet K-pax who arrived to Earth by a beam of light, while Dr. Powell played by Jeff Bridges tries to help him to solve his delusions... First of all, I must admit the cast is perfectly chosen: Kevin Spacey is really brilliant in portraying the intriguing character of Prot, always walking in the fine line of convincing us that it is real and then making us wonder whether he is delusional or not... Some of the gem scenes include the one where Prot innocently eats the whole banana (even the peal) while in session with Dr. Powell; or the observatory scene where he confidently shows his knowledge of the K-Pax system to the astonished astronomers... Jeff Bridges on the other hand is the subtle, rational side of this movie, and he delivers it perfectly. There is a whole other cast of excellent actors (like Saul Williams&#39; convincing performance as Ernie) who make this film truly work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;K-pax has it all, elements of comedy; Sci-Fi, even psychological thriller (concerning the Prot&#39;s identity) but most importantly it can be categorized as a heartwarming drama. The main premise of the movie is quite intricate, but the director never lets it get loose, he always keeps it believable and yet two-ways interpretable. The camera and photography have almost a crucial part here, continuing the main idea of light travel, there is much focus on light-shadow play, lightning settings - one of the memorable scenes is where Dr. Powell holds a crystal figure in his office which refracts light in a beautiful way while all the time he suspects can the idea be true? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Subtle and slow paced, intriguing and pleasurable, K-pax is truly a gem to watch, one of the kind movie that may not be for all tastes, but those who see it - might fall in love with it.&#34;
b&#34;if you watch this at home on DVD or Bluray! be sure you have great sound system. the musical score through this is what moves you through the movie. I have watched the movie several times and thought it was great but after just up-grading my home theater sound system, what a difference. I will be watching this movie many, many more times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you do not have a great sound system. find a friend who does and watch it there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also watch the extra stories and behind the scenes extras that come with it (the BR or DVD.) the interview of Quimet in the 1960&#39;s talks about his scholarship fund...but for those times just boys got it. today I hope some of it goes to girls.......&#34;
b&#39;The Long Kiss Goodnight has just about everything action fans want: a witty screenplay by the guy who wrote Lethal Weapon, Samuel L. Jackson, and great action set pieces by Renny Harlin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously underrated. One of the best action movies ever.&#39;
b&#34;This movie was over-shadowed by &#39;The Jackal&#39; (Bruce Willis, Richard Gere) which was released the same year. Having seen both films, I can honestly say this is the superior film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted, the production value of &#39;The Jackal&#39; was very good, it probably had a substantially bigger budget. However, &#39;The Assignment&#39; is well written and has a fascinating story. Aiden Quinn is flawless in dual roles. Aiden Quinn and director Christian Duguay did a great job of establishing a deep and multi-layered relationship between the title character and his family. I particularly liked the ending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was reminded of the Jack Ryan character in the Tom Clancy movies. Both are Naval officers thrown into unbelievably dangerous roles as they covertly work on behalf of National security. And yet, both Harrison Ford and Aidan Quinn reveal their respective characters as heros who manage to be both virile and gentle. They have a genuine tenderness and vulnerability in their relationships with their families. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#39;t understand is how the opinions of all who have posted on this movie (myself included) can be so much more positive than the luke-warm reception the film has received. This is a movie that has enough complexity and subtlety that it remains compelling after multiple viewings. If you are a fan of espionage-genre films, I recommend &#39;The Assignment&#39; enthusiastically.&#34;
b&#39;I personally have a soft spot for horror films that are set in hospitals and asylums so I had a good feeling about watching this &#34;Don\&#39;t Look in the Basement&#34;, even though its reputation is doubtful. Well, turned out I was right! This is great, trashy entertainment with a couple of efficient shocks and delightfully absurd characters. You have to, of course, look beyond the poor productions values and the completely illogical plot but, if you manage to do that (and if you\&#39;re a fan of this type of horror, that\&#39;s an essential quality), you\&#39;ll be rewarded with an outrageous &#34;video-nasty&#34; in which blood and insanity form the main elements. The young and cute nurse Charlotte arrives at a remote sanitarium where she\&#39;s supposed to start her new job. She finds out that the Doctor who hired her was killed by a patient and the replacement doctor-in-charge Masters seems reluctant to accept the new arrival. The life inside the sanitarium is rather peculiar, with the patients running around free and every door is kept unlocked. After a whole series of bizarre events, Charlotte discovers the horrific secrets that the institution hides.... The opening 10 minutes (pre-credits) are great and so is the completely deranged climax. Everything in between is pretty much without surprise or tension but you patiently wait because you just feel that the finale will be wild fun. The asylum\&#39;s patients are textbook lunatics, but I love them nevertheless. Some of my favorites include the former judge (who still talks exclusively in legal terms), the suspicious army-Sargeant and the mad-raving old lady. &#34;Don\&#39;t Look in the Basement&#34; is great low-brained fun, especially recommended to fans of 70\&#39;s trash-cinema, sick puppies and other types of scum. The lunatics have taken over the asylum, yeah!!&#39;
b&#34;I was fortunate to see a screening of this remarkable short film by Joshua Leonard before its premiere at the 2005 Sundance Festival. In twelve brief but exquisite minutes, Leonard takes us on a life-changing journey as he probes one of the most controversial contemporary social and ethical issues facing our society. The film embodies elegant direction, moving performances and a heart- rending story. Kelli Garner and Lucas Haas radiate as the two lovers. And, in his first venture into dramatic narrative, Leonard proves to be a director with a propitious future. I feel this short should be expanded into a feature film. It&#39;s difficult to describe talent, but as this debut film demonstrates, you know it when you see it!&#34;
b&#39;I was really surprised, that my mom watched whole movie without leaving to iron, clean or some other things like these. And I was almost shocked, when she said, it was very funny and very interesting. And I think so.&#39;
b&#34;This movie is my families favorite Christmas movie because it is a beautiful picture of what Christmas is really all about. These days living in a big city which I hate, I love to watch movies about the life I&#39;ve always dreamed of having. The town that this movie is set in is my dream come true for the life I&#39;ve always wanted and the true feeling of community that has been lost in todays society. I truly don&#39;t feel the true spirit of Christmas anymore but watching this movie helps to find that feeling again. My family taped this movie long ago of TV and now our copy has been worn out so I would really like to buy a few copies on DVD for my family and me if anyone can tell me where I can buy some copies please just post the info here and I will keep checking. Thanks.&#34;
b&#34;This film certainly wasn&#39;t very sophisticated. No, the humor was in fact pretty dumb now that I think about it. But, also while I think of it, I did laugh--proving decent comedy doesn&#39;t need to be very deep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fatty Arbuckle is the definite star of this short, despite Buster Keaton&#39;s appearing in the film as well. He is the butcher in an old-time grocery store. A lot of silly stuff occurred in the store and I think I laughed the most at the coffee grinder sequence--you&#39;ll just have to see it yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, later, Fatty&#39;s girlfriend is forced to go to a girls&#39; school and because he can&#39;t stand to part, he dresses in drag and infiltrates the school. Arbuckle is one ugly woman! So, for silly and unsophisticated fun, see this film. It won&#39;t change your life and is a very slight picture, but it&#39;s also fun.&#34;
b&#39;Cleopatra (the delicious Monica Bellucci) is challenged by Cesar (Alain Chabat): in order to prove that the Egyptians are better than the Romans, she promises to build a fancy castle for Cesar in a period of three months, without any delay. She calls the one-arm architect Numerobis (Jamel Debbuzi) and gives him two options: to be covered by gold if he accomplishes his mission, or become crocodile food if he fails. Numerobis will ask for help to Panoramix (Claude Rich), Asterix (Christian Clavier) and Obelix (Geraard Depardieu) (with Ideiafix). This movie is very funny, specially the parts where Obelix and the Pirates leaded by Red Beard participate. However, the screenwriter and the director should have noted that French is not an universal language as English is. Therefore, the jokes with words (like in Austin Powers movies, for example) does not work well for people strange to French language. French people and persons fluent in French language will certainly like these jokes, but they do not make any sense for me, that do not speak French. My vote is seven.&#39;
b&#34;Rather than go on location and make a realistic film about drug addiction in the Windy City, contrarian director Otto Preminger decided to go the opposite way and make his movie appear as artificial as possible, thus flying in the face of the fashion set by men like Kazan, Huston and Zinnemann, who were making their pictures all over the world. Nelson Algren, on whose novel the movie is based, went on record as despising it. What, one wonders, was Preminger up to, and why did he do the movie this way?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sets in the film are so minimal as to suggest a Mr. Magoo cartoon. Louie, the drug pusher, is attired as to resemble the sort of gangster the artists at Mad magazine used to draw. Arnold Stang, wonderful comedian that he was, seems out of place in a serious picture like this, and his very appearance, topped off by an exaggerated and over-sized baseball cap, elicits laughter. Robert Strauss, another actor best known for humorous roles, is likewise out of place, as his large, heavily jowled face and Runyonesque delivery of lines seems more appropriate to a Jerry Lewis movie. Against all this, stars Frank Sinatra, Kim Novak and Eleanor Parker have to work overtime to just keep the viewer from snickering. Sinatra is jittery and manic throughout, suggesting a man ill at ease with himself, hence wholly appropriate for the role of a drug addict. Miss Novak, plant-like and sublimely deadpan, is sympathetic and seems a product of the artfully dingy slums she graces in the film. Parker is pure Hollywood and very hard-working as the crippled and crafty Zosch. She is never convincing, but then neither is the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#39;t recommend this movie to anyone interested in a realistic depiction of the lives of drug addicts in America. The Caligari sets alone make it unbelievable. Preminger may have been aiming for a dream effect, as the cardboard backgrounds give the proceedings the surreal feeling of a nightmare operetta, perhaps harking back to Preminger&#39;s early days in Vienna.&#34;
b&#34;To keep it as simple as possible. This is a very good show. That is well written, and has a fantastic cast. It&#39;s not loaded with blood and guts. And centers around a disgraced cop and his relationship with his ex-wife, his son, his former partner (Andre Braugher), his childhood friend, now a priest (George Dzunzda), and lastly the person who happens to get into his hack in that episode. Are you likely to find something like this going on in your city NO. Is this still a good story YES. And it&#39;s nice to see a man portrayed as good father in spite of his flaws. Watch more then one ( 2-3) and you&#39;ll see why a lot of us are hooked on this show. And thank you David Morse for making this character so interesting. Another good job!&#34;
b&#34;This is an excellent movie. Phoolan had no role model&#39;s to base her actions on, yet was able to bring about very necessary change to a land that was living in darkness when it comes to female treatment. I like the fact that it was a real story rather than made up, it added to the horror of the story, &amp; the triumph.&#34;
b&#34;Do-It-Yourself indie horror auteur Todd Sheets returns with another entertainingly atrocious nickel&#39;n&#39;dime shot-on-video clunker that&#39;s basically just a feeble excuse to sling around a lot of watery blood and gleaming guts as often as possible. An evil demonic scarecrow resurrects the dead as ravenous rot-faced zombies so they can feast on the living. A bunch of bickering college kids, a trio of dangerous escaped convicts led by the vicious Slade (Byron Nichodemus hamming it up to an outrageous degree), two equally savage sleazeball hoodlums, and a trio of hottie sisters all have to do their best to survive this harrowing ordeal. That&#39;s it for the needlessly muddled and convoluted plot, but fortunately what this hilariously horrendous hoot lacks in narrative coherence (plenty) it more than compensates for with a pleasing plethora of gloriously gross&#39;n&#39;graphic gore. Disgusting highlights include a woman having her fingers chopped off, a fatal gunshot to a young gal&#39;s groin, attempted necrophiliac rape, evisceration, and, of course, more repulsive entrail eating than you can shake a pile of moist intestines at. Moreover, we&#39;ve also got rough, grainy cinematography that constantly alternates between washed-out color and grimy black and white, ineptly staged fight scenes, lousy acting from a uniformly pathetic no-name cast (Jerry Angell in particular cops the top crummy thespic dishonors for his laughably abysmal histrionics as slimy no-count psycho criminal Joe Bob), a grating head-banging thrash metal soundtrack, and a generic shivery&#39;n&#39;ominous synthesizer score. Let&#39;s not forget the ridiculous ending in which several of our survivors stumble across a few vials of flesh-eating bacteria to use on the shambling undead hordes. Sure, this flick is pure dreck, but it has a certain endearingly abominable quality to it that in turn makes it a great deal of so-awful-it&#39;s-awesome Grade Z fun for hardcore aficionados of bad fright fare.&#34;

b&#39;Storyline drags. Drug smugglers a Beautiful women and a determined cop. Nothing not already done a hundred times before. The boat sceen will be well worth the wait Amsterdam is the perfect city to pull it off. The canals and waterways put you on the edge of your seat. I would say the same as did the car chase in Bullitt, very intense!.&#39;
b&#39;I guess they reward idiocy today because whoever came up with the concept for this movie was not shot on sight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a morons delight. The worst stereo-types of every ghetto and high school movie is dragged out twisted around and made even more unbearable. Every character in this movie has a sob story beyond sympathy. Lets pray for a remake where the whole school gets nuked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Spoiler*** how does a school so run down have the internet in the first place?&#39;
b&#39;i believe that this movie was a terrible waste of my time, and i would know after watching it 5 times in class. this movie does not show what absolutely perfectly happened during these times. no one can truly say that these things happened to the letter. if anything the only good part would be the actors, even tho that they were really really crap.they were reading the script without expression. quite boring. i would rather watch play school. so i would definitely like to never ever see this movie again in my whole life. it is a complete waste of time unless you want your time to be wasted and if you would like to see an unrealistic view of what happened back in 1981.&#39;
b&#34;Leonard can write lyrics, but he sure can&#39;t sing. Nor has he had an original idea in his life, just a floater. From the looks of this nasty little puff piece (note that his publishers, McClelland and Stewart were involved in the production), he didn&#39;t know how to live, either. The woman he loves is only mentioned in passing and no woman is allowed to speak in this nonsensical advertisement. While Irving Layton was given a credit, the other poet interviewed, Earle Birney, was to remain nameless. I come from the generation just after Cohen, where all the boys seemed to idolize him. His lack of commitment was probably just calling to them. I hadn&#39;t realized what a disappointing poseur he was back then. I was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt because of his age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whiny, little rich prince, and not one memorable line in his oeuvre. No dedication to social change, outside of the sexual arena.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#39;t speak for my generation, Lennie, and not for my gender. Go back to the monastery and stay off the screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for my local public broadcaster, I will let them know what I think of them wasting my time on this guy. Not a has-been, a never was...&#34;
b&#39;I had a hard time staying awake for the two hour opening episode. It was dumbed down to such an extent, I doubt if I learned a single thing. The graphics were rudimentary. Any small idea was repeated ad nauseum. Contrast this to the Cosmos series hosted by Carl Sagan. That had a good musical theme. There was NO music coming from these infernal 10-dimensional Strings.&#39;
b&#34;The hero John Keem is going after some drug dealers who kidnaps girls for some reason. On his journey he uses karate and kung fu moves and I don&#39;t believe he got hit a single time during the movie. This is Crap.&#34;
b&#39;and nothing else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my friends bought the Problem Child Tantrum Pack (contains the first two &#34;Problem Child&#34;s in one disc), and we decided to watch the sequel because it was &#34;funnier&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were many funny moments in the movie (the vomit scene, that\&#39;s all I need to say.), Nippy the dog after eating CHOW DOWN, and numerous others. The movie is nothing but toilet humor, but it\&#39;s hilarious. Other than the funny moments, though, this movie has little to offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John Ritter annoys the crap out of me, because it sounds like he\&#39;s reading out of a book. The man can\&#39;t act in this one, sorry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I can\&#39;t say if I would find the movie funny now...(we were blown when we watched it), it\&#39;s a perfect movie for a rainy day...but nothing else. Don\&#39;t expect Oscar material on this one, guys.&#39;
b&#39;Some Plot Spoilers Ahead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Nashville Network\&#39;s so-called rebirth as &#34;The First Network for Men&#34; is a complete disappointment, as was its block of adult cartoons. The new Ren and Stimpy was just plain awful, &#34;Gary the Rat&#34; mediocre at best, and &#34;Stripperella&#34; pretty unwatchable. This cartoon is mostly boring; if &#34;Ren and Stimpy&#34; suffered from gross-out overkill, &#34;Stripperella&#34; lacked any decent shock gags, funny witless gags, clever gags, or gags, period. The concept is bad to begin with: Pamela Anderson, a stripper-cum-superheroine, saves &#34;The City&#34; from an assortment of goofy supervillains. This cartoon seems like an homage to superior wacky superhero spoofs, like &#34;Darkwing Duck&#34; and &#34;The Tick,&#34; but without those cartoons\&#39; wit and good writing---or even good storyboarding. &#34;Agent 0069&#34; tries to vacillate between being goofy and sexy, but she is neither, and this cartoon\&#39;s failure to make her one or the other brings this series down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch your taped episodes of &#34;The Tick,&#34; and see what a real superhero spoof cartoon is like.&#39;
b&#34;Bizarre. This movie is supposed to be based on a famous photographer, but everything that happens in this movie is fiction. I guess it tries to explain why Diane Arbus had a fascination with oddities and made it her primary photography focus. In the movie, wolfman moves into the apartment above hers. She seemingly becomes obsessed with him and falls for him. She puts her kids and husband second over the wolfman, and even tries to incorporate him into her family gatherings. Some of the wolfman&#39;s freak show side kicks come over to visit and she mingles with them. The whole thing is very bizarre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FINAL VERDICT: Nothing memorable. There is just something weird about a woman who gets her jollies from shaving the wolfman. I think you can find better films out there.&#34;
b&#39;Some people like to tell you that Deep Space 9 is the best of all the Star Trek shows, because it stresses character development and continuity, and features a more complex background and ongoing plots. In some ways this makes it more satisfying, but in many ways the show fails entirely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The series starts out as a soap opera on a space station, with two entire seasons of generic science fiction stories balanced with banal subplots about the characters. The characters are a good bunch, and most of the actors are decent, but I think the writers tried too hard to make them &#34;normal&#34;. By &#34;normal&#34; they actually mean &#34;ordinary and tedious&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of Season Two we are introduced to the Dominion, who hang around menacingly for a while before finally going to war with the good guys in Season Five. This is the main &#34;story arc&#34; of the show, but it only takes up a fraction of the entire series. We still get lame stand-alone episodes, heroes still get stranded on weird planets for forty-five minutes, and there\&#39;s an awful lot of low-brow comedy featuring the greedy, goofy Ferengi. A lot of episodes are merely dull, and some are unwatchable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Dominion, DS9\&#39;s main villains, are bent on galactic domination for the convenient reason that, well, they just don\&#39;t like anyone. The entire war is presented with a naive lack of moral complexity and imagination. Impressively pyrotechnic space battles appear with great frequency from Season Three onwards, but these are carried out in ludicrously simplistic ways, such as two huge fleets of super-advanced starships flying right at each other and blasting away. The writers of DS9 (including the talented Ronald D. Moore, later of &#34;Battlestar Galactica&#34; fame) spiced up their monotonous show by starting a war, but at heart it is still a pedantic soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DS9 remains a very frustrating experience. The continuous story is too flat and obvious to be really gripping, and the characters never truly develop in interesting ways. &#34;Babylon 5&#34; and &#34;Battlestar Galactica&#34; both fulfilled the promise made by DS9, and did everything much better. For Star Trek, stick with the original and the Next Generation.&#39;
b&#39;I\&#39;m gettin\&#39; sick of movies that sound entertaining in a one-line synopsis then end up being equal to what you\&#39;d find in the bottom center of a compost heap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who knows: &#34;Witchery&#34; may have sounded interesting in a pitch to the studios, even with a &#34;big name cast&#34; (like Blair and Hasselhoff - wink-wink, nudge-nudge) and the effervescent likes of Hildegard Knef (I dunno, some woman...).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But on film, it just falls apart faster than a papier-mache sculpture in a rainstorm. Seems these unfortunate folks are trapped in an island mansion off the Eastern seaboard, and one of them (a woman, I\&#39;d guess) is being targeted by a satanic cult to bear the child of hell while the others are offed in grotesque, tortuous ways. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, right there you have a cross-section of plots from &#34;The Exorcist&#34;, &#34;The Omen&#34;, &#34;Ten Little Indians&#34; and a few other lesser movies in the satanic-worshippers-run-amok line. None of it is very entertaining and for the most part, you\&#39;ll cringe your way from scene to scene until it\&#39;s over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, not even Linda Blair and David Hasselhoff help matters much. They\&#39;re just in it to pick up a paycheck and don\&#39;t seem very intent on giving it their &#34;all&#34;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the looks of it, Hasselhoff probably wishes he were back on the beack with Pam Anderson (and who can blame him?) and Linda... well, who knows; a celebrity PETA benefit or pro-am golf tour or whatever it is she\&#39;s in to nowadays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the torture scenes! Ecchhhh. You\&#39;ll see people get their mouths sewn shut, dangled up inside roaring fireplaces, strung up in trees during a violent storm, vessels bursting out of their necks, etc, etc. Sheesh, and I thought &#34;Mark of the Devil&#34; was the most sadistic movie I\&#39;d seen....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don\&#39;t bother. It\&#39;s not worth your time. I can\&#39;t believe I told you as much as I did. If you do watch it, just see if you can count the cliches. And yes, Blair gets possessed, as if you didn\&#39;t see THAT coming down Main Street followed by a marching band.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No stars. &#34;Witchery&#34; - these witches will give you itches.&#39;
b&#39;his has to surely be one of the worst gay-themed films of all time. Who told any of the so-called actors that they can act. Bad sound - bad script - gestures so overboard that they defy reality. A nightclub scene with only one actor and dubbed crowd scenes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After seeing other low budget films similarly made I was prepared for something innovative - but not plain pathetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parents and friends really should not encourage anyone to make such tripe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the DVD - No menu access; its worse than a VHS tape. Once you start you have to watch the whole thing through - luckily the fast forward button works - with this film and DVD nothing else does.&#39;
b&#39;&#34;Cleo\&#39;s Second Husband&#34; is an amateurish attempt at psychodrama with more to fault than to praise. The plot is hacked, the story monotonous, the acting poor, the execution second rate, etc. Not worth the time unless maybe your a relative of one of the actors. PU! (D)&#39;
b&#39;What a crap that movie is. The script is simply non existent. The movie at times seems like a music video. But it cannot even be that since the soundtrack does not really match. Pathetic way of combining action and rap. One might think it being a recipe for a successful flick... here it fails miserably. Dialogues in this flick just killed me. The scene when Harlan is interrogated by some policeman is merely pitiful. Generally speaking, recent Seagals films are hardly watchable. What the hell happened to the guy? I know he\&#39;s old but can\&#39;t he get &#34;Hollywood&#34; to drop him a decent script or something? Is he running out of dough for his escapades to India that he takes on anything they serve him?&#39;
b&#39;This was the most uninteresting horror flick I have seen to date. The premise is glaringly forgotten after about 1 minute. The acting is terrible. The scariest thing about this movie is when the two guys kiss, yuck! What were the film festival judges thinking when they gave this garbage a \&#39;best film\&#39; notation? The only reasons I didn\&#39;t turn this movie off were to see what NOT to do as a filmmaker, and if the paper-thin plot line could really keep going on as is was. I was not disappointed by this latter notion. There wasn\&#39;t even a single bit of nudity or gore to keep the kiddies interested! Also, I thought it was tacky to use about 3 minutes of &#34;Resident Evil 2&#34; in the movie... Was that supposed to be filler? \&#39;cause it was the goriest and most interesting part of the movie.&#39;
b&#34;The whole movie seemed to suffer from poor editing - every scene seemed to take forever to unfold and when they did, I felt like I had waited a long time for very little to happen. I guess I missed the whole point of the movie - either that or there wasn&#39;t one.&#34;
b&#34;Where do I start. Lets list the good things about this movie first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Mikael Persbrandt is great as the Gangster Thomas. This is the only character you will actually care about, and he&#39;s a bad guy! (allthogh never does anything bad, and is generally a pretty likable guy) 2. Kjell Bergkvist is always great. He&#39;s a bit toned down here, but he is quite funny still 3. The movie looked pretty good by Swedish standards, good use of depth of field and lights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the bad. This is by far the worst script to make it into the big screen ever. The acting by everyone else was pretty bad and over the top. The direction was horrible. A totally meaningless story, totally unrealistic characters and events and 1.5 hours to long. During emotional scenes pretty much everyone in the theater laughed. People just started walking out during the course of the screening. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#39;s no way to actually summarize the story into something coherent, so I wont even try. Every clich\xc3\xa9 ever conceived is in there, and in all the wrong places. I&#39;m sorry to say this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my entire life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch it for a good laugh, but try not to pay any money for it ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.R&#34;
b&#39;Am I the only one who thought the point of this film was the graphic violence? I knew nothing about Leigh Scott when I rented it, and would not have done so if I had known that most of his previous films were horror films. I am not into that at all, I was just expecting an informative docudrama of the 9/11 report.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead, I got an almost incomprehensible, violent movie. The only good thing about it for me, was that it made me want to read the report, to figure out what the heck this movie was about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wrote this because I am shocked that we have become so immune to violence in films and on TV, that it was not even worth commenting on by the bloggers whose reviews that I read.&#39;
b&#39;Talk about rubbish! I can\&#39;t think of one good thing in this movie. The screenplay was poor, the acting was terrible and the effects, well there were no effects. I can\&#39;t believe the writer of this movie did Identity, everything in this movie made me sick to start to finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The front cover of the video box shows a showman with shark like teeth and scary eyes. I looks like a scary villain, but like the old saying &#34;never judge a book by it\&#39;s cover&#34;, the whole villain looked like a cardboard cut out. One part in the film a girl gets killed by a salad tongs, terrible. The setting was bad enough, like they could of set the whole thing in Lapland but no, a tropical island instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took this movie as a spoof, which I think they wanted it to be but the only thing that made me laugh in a bad way was the tacky effects. You can argue that I haven\&#39;t watched the first one, but seeing this I would be safe if I wouldn\&#39;t attempted it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest joke in this movie is the effects, the snowballs looked like they were home made, and that carrot was a complete embarrassment. If I would of guess the budget of this movie would of probably be between 8 to 9 pounds fifty. The producer in a last minute panic must of grabbed the actors for the street gave them the script told them they have 6 minutes to practise these lines and shoot on a island.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly the acting in the film was painful, it was like the actors forgot their ordinary lines and made them up the way through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion I give this film: 0 stars out of 5&#39;
b&#39;**SPOILERS** The third and mercifully last of the Aztec Mummy trilogy in the fact that the series major star-besides the Mummy- actor Ramon Gay, as Dr. Eduardo Almada, was gunned down by the outraged husband of a woman he was having an affair with on May 28, 1960! Still that didn\&#39;t stop Gay, in him being edited into them from his previous films, from being in a number of future Mexican horror movies made over the next four years after his death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &#34;Robot vs the Aztec Mummy&#34; we have the once again mad scientist Dr. Krupp trying to get his hands on the Mummy\&#39;s golden breastplate and bracelet in order, by having them deciphered, to find the Aztez treasure that\&#39;s been secretly buried somewhere in modern Mexico City over 500 years ago. &#34;Robot vs the Aztec Mummy&#34; is not much as a movie in itself in that its made up of stock footage of the previous Aztec Mummy films that take up over half of the films running time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After getting introduced to the movie\&#39;s cast members, some who have been killed in the previous Aztec Mummy films, we get down to the real nitty gritty in it involving the evil as well as criminally insane Dr. Krupp also know as &#34;The Bat&#34;. Dr. Krupp-who looks like a wild eyed and crazed Orson Wells-is a man with boundless visions of grandeur in him not only uncovering the long lost Aztec treasure but now, unlike in the two previous movies he was in, creating life and using it in making an army of human robots to take over the world. An idea he must have gotten from watching Ed Wood\&#39;s 1955 &#34;Atomic Superman&#34; classic &#34;Bride of the Monster&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unable to handle the Mummy in his two other encounters with it, where he ended up getting thrown by it into a snake pit filled with deadly rattlers, Dr. Krupp had created a robot, with a human cadaver stuffed in it, to the job, of doing in the Mummy, for him. With he Mummy sleeping in its tomb at a local Mexico City cemetery Dr. Krupp has his Robot-Man brake into the Mummy\&#39;s crypt to do battle with it and destroy it with its bolts of deadly radiation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***SPOILERS*** The big built-up to the Aztec Mummy Robot-Man confrontation turns to be a big let-down with the Mummy having no trouble at all dispatching the &#34;Tin-Man&#34; in less then 30 seconds together with its creator Dr. Krupp. All this while both Dr. Almada and his friend and assistant Pinacate, who came to the Mummy\&#39;s aid, have nothing at all to do but sit back and watch the action. Now without the mad and off-the-wall Dr. Krupp annoying it the Mummy can go back to its eternal resting place without ever worrying about the problems of the modern world at large, like Dr. Krupp, that it has really no interest in.&#39;
b&#34;I thought this movie was going to be good. It absolutely wasn&#39;t, despite the Oscar-winning lead actors. I may have laughed once, and I never heard anybody else in the theater laughing. Renee Zellweger&#39;s pancake make-up was very unbecoming. Everybody seems to be trying so hard in this movie, running around in imitation of slapstick but not pulling it off. I think perhaps the movie must&#39;ve sounded good in development, but something got lost in translation. Were the roaring 20&#39;s really like this? I think not. Everything seems a tad artificial. Randy Newman&#39;s score was annoying. The film is in sepia tones, just like every other movie that takes place in the 20&#39;s or 30&#39;s. There&#39;s just not that much originality here.&#34;
b&#39;I\&#39;m not sure what the point of making this film was. It looked as if it was made by some historical society to be shown in your local \&#39;Pistol Pete\&#39; museum. At first it appears that it could be the beginning of a Mad TV or SNL sketch. But then the joke is on you when there is no punchline and you realize that someone was taking this seriously. The story wasn\&#39;t bad but the inclusion of the SASS members seemed to be a ploy (that worked) to get me to see the film. I swear, the trailer listed every character in the film down to &#34;dead cowboy #5&#34;. The reason Westerns are so fun is the atmosphere and the characters it brings. I just had the feeling I was watching Civil War rean-actors dressed up as cowboys. Not even worth the digital video it was recorded on.&#39;
b&#34;The comments already left for this show are way more funny than the show itself and they are all accurate. I feel exactly the same way, that I am very disappointed at how far Rick Mercer has fallen when he used to do some really great things on This Hour Has 22 Minutes but now he is just clowning around, going places and talking to people. He does some bits in the studio about things going on in the news but they are never funny at all, just really sad and predictable jokes about headlines. Most of his show is him going somewhere to talk to people, for example this week he is going to a rodeo and the video pieces are all of him making funny faces and acting scared of the wild horses, etc. He used to be funny but has gotten way less funny since leaving This Hour Has 22 Minutes and that show is also not funny at all any more. Now that Air Farce is off the air (finally thank goodness!) Mercer and This Hour Has 22 Minutes have got to be next in line for the axe, just old tired predictable comedy that almost nobody finds funny any more. It&#39;s sad really considering Rick Mercer used to be the funniest man on Canadian TV!&#34;
b&#39;OK i gave this a three A three! It deserves only one star no questions asked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your going to look at the movie seriously and take it as a legit B-Horror movie than yes it will get one star. But i believe it is apparent within the first minutes of the movie what we are dealing with is a piece of crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this movie me and the buddy i was watching it with could of turned it off and put on something more &#34;Hollywood&#34; but instead we just decided to rip this whole movie apart from start to finish. We laughed so many times it was almost if i was watching a comedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting is terrible..... The effects and death sequences are so bad.... The Story complete crap.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the fact they are trying to make a serious horror movie..Priceless!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most memorable part for me is when two of the characters are walking in a supposed &#34;dark basement&#34; which is clearly lit, and they pretend to not be able to see bumping into bones hanging from the ceiling bahahahaha just terrible.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you want to laugh at how crappy this movie is, along with the fact it was made in 2004 than see this movie....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wait why am i writing so much? no one knows about this movie...i doubt anyone will even read this hahahaha.&#39;
b&#39;I haven\&#39;t seen this film in years, but the awful &#34;taste&#34; of Quaid\&#39;s performance still lingers on my tongue. Some have commented on how Quaid has Jerry Lee Lewis &#34;to a tee&#34; but the fact is he only appears to have the most extreme stage Jerry in mind. Nobody acts that way all the time, and the performance comes off as hopelessly clownish, reducing Lewis to a buffoonish caricature. The nuances of a man\&#39;s life are lost in the rubble of sheer over-acting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The author of the book this is based on (Nick Tosches) is a good writer, who has written several fine musical bios (I particularly liked &#34;Dino&#34; on Dean Martin); in the books Tosches gives us a full human being, both separate from and involved in the &#34;biz.&#34; Quaid\&#39;s acting seems to imply that Jerry never acted like a human being. If people were like this, no one would bother to hang around them. As cartoons go, it is mildly amusing, but otherwise it is one of the most egregious, film-destroying performances I have had the &#34;honor&#34; of viewing. Terrible...&#39;
b&#39;Five Fingers is so bad, that I hardly know where to begin. So let me admit first, that I have only seen the first half hour. When the first finger had been chopped off, I thought sleeping a more useful activity. I told my girlfriend the meaning of &#34;five fingers&#34; and she immediately followed my example.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couldn\&#39;t the producer, the director and/or the scriptwriter consult a chess-amateur? Like me? They should have used a digital chess-clock and not an analogue. This major goof makes the mental pressure put on Martijn just a laugh. How, when and why did Martijn date a Moroccan girlfriend? Such an affair is very rare in The Netherlands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Calling me a retard is of course an insult to all those people suffering with a much lower than average IQ. Moreover, as far as I know, retards don\&#39;t play chess. I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest problem is the script of course. Just compare the little intelligent movie Hard Candy. To keep the spectator in a grip, the information must be revealed bit by bit. A nice twist now and then also helps. I understood from other reviews, that there is a big one at the end of the movie. Any smart person can guess what it is. This of course just raises more questions - why is the travel guide killed? Oh my, why should I even care? The whole movie focuses on just one thing: the chopped fingers. The makers have not even learned Hitchcock\&#39;s lesson: it is thrilling to get a bomb exploded. It is more thrilling to show that bomb ticking. But no, we don\&#39;t see the paper-cutter until the impossible countdown is over. I will not waste more words on this crap. Go see Hard Candy.&#39;
b&#34;Stephen King TV movies can go 5 or 6 parts and no one complains, right? So why give the Stooges only 96 minutes? I&#39;m not asking for a PBS mini-series, but would a two parter had killed anyone? The movie steamrolled over events that should have been mentioned and mentioned events that could have been omitted. I do want to give a salute to the performances of the stars...they had a tough job because they didn&#39;t really look like the Stooges, but the spirit was there. After watching the movie, I pulled out a tape from American Movie Classics that had the real deal on it and laughed myself silly. The movie was pretty tough emotionally, especially after Curly has the stroke and Moe needs to keep the business going. When Curley started crying I lost it...Like I said, the movie was good, but could have been and SHOULD have been much, much better. Maybe it&#39;s fitting though...the Stooges got ripped off when they were alive and now, 25 years later, it happens again.&#34;
b&#34;I went to see this movie with my boyfriend last night. I&#39;m 20 years old and this movie was way too much for ME. I couldn&#39;t imagine taking a teenager, preteen, or (especially) a child to this movie. It was crude and offensive. I was totally misled by its PG-13 rating and the previews that I had seen for it. I had originally seen previews for it on Nickelodeon, and I thought that it looked pretty cute (maybe I just don&#39;t remember the preview correctly) . Plus, Drake Bell (the movie&#39;s main character) stars on a Nickelodeon television show that targets preteens and young teenagers. I really didn&#39;t think that the movie&#39;s content would be as risky as it was. I should have done more research about it before I went. However, I&#39;m hoping that parents will read up on this movie before they take their kids to see it just because it has Drake Bell in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, do NOT take your kids or teenagers to see this movie. The rating should have been R. There are tons of sexual references, drug references, and disturbing events throughout the movie. Examples: Drake Bell gets attacked by sexually charged animals, several scenes that involve men grabbing women&#39;s breasts, lots of profanity, Drake Bell uses a bong to smoke vanilla frosting (or something like that), people get stabbed, hit, and hurt in the movie, and an elderly lady and her dog get shredded. There are tons of other offensive and disgusting scenes throughout the movie. It was really demeaning to women in general. The movie is by the people that made the Scary Movie series, so that should tell you something right there. Please remember that seeing movies like this can give kids and teenagers all kinds of wrong ideas about sex, drugs, and violence. Most children and teenagers can&#39;t decipher between spoofs or comedy and reality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have a sense of humor. I also know that the humor that was in this film is typical of its genre. But I find the possibility of children and teenagers going to see this movie HORRIFYING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the overall quality of the movie, I didn&#39;t think it was that original or funny. It dragged in parts and some of the humor was just forced and painful. The acting wasn&#39;t TOO bad, considering how bad the script was. If you&#39;re an adult or older teen looking for a funny movie, skip this one or rent it.&#34;
b&#39;I guess that after Leonard Nimoy had been successful in directing &#34;the Search for Spock&#34; and &#34;the Voyage Home,&#34; William Shatner thought he could direct too. Although he is a competent actor, he shows here that he\&#39;s just not a good director.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, this movie is hard evidence to support the arguments of Trekkies who say that William Shatner being an arrogant egomaniac. For although his character, Captain James Kirk, was always arguably the most important role in the original &#34;Star Trek,&#34; it seems in this movie that he is the heart of the movie, the two other most important characters, Captain Spock and Doctor Leonard McCoy, are just there to support him, and the other characters are just there to add comic relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot is that some emotional Vulcan outcast named Sybok is mindmelding with people and releasing the pain bottled up inside them from that traumatic event early in life that changed them forever. Grateful, they join him in his quest to make the entire world free of pain and thus at peace. Sybok and his followers commandeer the building in which a peace conference between a Human, Klingon, and Romulan diplomat is taking place. This lures the still-being-constructed Enterprise there, since none of Starfleet\&#39;s other ships have &#34;experienced commanders&#34; (honestly, with how Starfleet is run, the Klingons and Romulans should have conquered them years ago). Sybok adds the Enterprise\&#39;s crew, save Spock (who is revealed to be secret brothers with Sybok), McCoy, and Kirk. Sybok orders that the Enterprise take off to &#34;the center of the universe&#34; to meet &#34;God,&#34; who apparently every race has a word for. However, it turns out that this is only a minor entity when he demands the use of the Enterprise and Kirk asks, &#34;what does God need with a starship.&#34; The entity is destroyed, but not before Sybok, realizing he\&#39;s been lied to for years, sacrifices his life and earns Spock\&#39;s respect in death after the Enterprises photon torpedos destroy the entity and inexplicably Sybok as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, science fiction movies are not known for realism, but at some point, rationality must be enforced. Why do people follow Sybok just for releasing their pain? Why are all humanoids defined by a single traumatic event? I\&#39;ve certainly led a trauma-free life. Why doesn\&#39;t Kirk try his crew for mutiny and treason after they join Sybok? What was the point of Sybok sacrificing himself when the torpedos were going to kill the entity anyway?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the plot\&#39;s weak. Another problem is that Sybok, though played well by Lawrence Luckinbill, is poorly portrayed. Just because he\&#39;s an emotional Vulcan doesn\&#39;t mean he should act exactly like a Human religious fanatic. Shatner (who was a co-writer as well as the director) could have at least developed dialog fitting for an emotional Vulcan. I guess he feels that any emotional being talks like us. Gee, I guess that means that Klingons should say &#34;isn\&#39;t&#34; and &#34;don\&#39;t&#34; more often than &#34;is not&#34; and &#34;do not.&#34; And the Cardassians shouldn\&#39;t prolong their sentences because they like to talk (yeah, I know it\&#39;s sad that I know this). Please... every ST race uses unique dialog. Why is Sybok the exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing to not complain about is the acting. I\&#39;ve always known &#34;Star Trek&#34; to have great actors, and this movie is not exception. Cudos also go to Leonard Nimoy, for it had to be difficult to play the dispassionate Spock in his old age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some other things I didn\&#39;t like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shatner and the late DeForrest Kelly twice show what bad singers they are by singing &#34;Row, Row, Row your Boat&#34; in this movie. I guess Shatner wished to silence his detractors of his singing ability. What he did was prove their point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Uhura does a fan dance while wearing nothing but tree bark to draw some men into a booby trap. After all, the dreams of all us men are filled with images of middle-aged plump women dancing naked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comedy\&#39;s all well and good as long as it doesn\&#39;t affect the nature of &#34;Star Trek&#34; too much, but when Scotty bumps into an object on the Enterprise and KOs himself, it\&#39;s kinda goin\&#39; overboard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kirk is the only crew member who can reject Sybok\&#39;s offer of releasing their inner pain and see through the God imposter\&#39;s deception. Not even Spock can manage either of these? Perhaps this scenes were valantines from Shatner to his character, as many suspect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The concept of an entity posing as God had been used in &#34;Star Trek&#34; before this movie more than once. Be creative, Shatner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of uncreativeness, I didn\&#39;t purticularly care for the ripping off of the music of &#34;Star Trek: the Next Generation.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, pretty bad &#34;Trek&#34; movie. If you\&#39;re a Trekkie, watch it once because it\&#39;s &#34;Star Trek.&#34; Otherwise, watch &#34;Star Trek II: the Wrath of Khan.&#34; It\&#39;s way better.&#39;
b&#39;A man comes to the office of the psychiatric Dr. Sammael (Joan Severance) claiming to be the demon Asmodeus (Kane Hodder), the torturer of the 13th level of the hell, and he would like to tell weird things. He tells that he had made a deal with Lucifer to become human again. He should knock-up his virgin sister Mary Elizabeth (Alison Brie) on the day that their mother died and she should kill six people and deliver the Anti-Christ, and then he would escape from the pit and reborn. When Mary Elizabeth gets pregnant, her stressed and abusive sister Catherine (Denise Crosby) does not believe that she is virgin, but their father and former obstetrician Albert Martino (James Callahan) examines his daughter and sees her intact hymen. Meanwhile the Church discovers the truth about Mary Elizabeth\&#39;s pregnancy and sends the priest and former military Father Anthony (Eddie Velez) to spy Mary Elizabeth. She is dominated by the fetus and forced to kill a truck driver, Lars (Jorg Sirtl), who is the lover of her tenant and friend Jennifer (Azalea Davila), and Jennifer herself and eat their hearts and drink their bloods, but she believes that she has nightmares. However during the ultrasound, she realizes that she is carrying a monster and she asks her father to stop her pregnancy. But it is too late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The awful &#34;Born&#34; is a B-movie (actually a Z-movie) that believes that is a great movie. The result is a pretentious and disappointing production, with an incoherent and absurd story without humor and terrible acting and direction. The plot is a complete mess: there is a priest that is a hit-man and former soldier; a demon in existential crisis going to a psychiatric; a father that examines the virginity of his daughter; two female-demons (succubus?) that stand naked like a statue with both hands covering their sexes; a character that is a slut, and only exists to expose her beautiful body. There are many scenes with free and cheap nudity. But the worst is the acting: the unknown lead actress Alison Brie is histrionic, with ridiculous voices and grimaces. Sorry, Ms. Alison Brie, but I hated your annoying performance. I have not recognized Joan Severance, who has a good performance, since I still had the image of her youth. Denise Crosby performs a hateful character and like everybody, she got older but she is still a good actress. I believe that if the writer and the director had included some dark humor and assumed that this movie is a B-movie, the story might have worked better and better. My vote is three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Title (Brazil): &#34;O Anti-Cristo&#34; (&#34;The Anti-Christ&#34;)&#39;
b&#39;CONGO is probably the worst big-budget movie of the 1990s. It is so bad that it is watchable over and over again. A bunch of folks with different agendas probe deep into darkest Africa, where they encounter a temple of riches just like in KING SOLOMON\&#39;S MINES -- but with cannibalistic gorillas guarding those riches. On their side, the humans have a &#34;talking&#34; gorilla named Amy who helps save the day at one point or another. So much for the plot. The dialogue throughout is witless, the acting almost uniformly atrocious, certainly campy (Tim Curry and Ernie Hudson are both on hand to assure the ham factor), and the special effects abysmal. Wait until you see the cannibalistic gorillas. And the lava! Oh yes, did I mention there\&#39;s a volcanic eruption to top off the big finale? Laura Linney of all people is along for this bumpiest of rides. What could she have been thinking? This is right around the same time she appeared with Richard Gere and Ed Norton in PRIMAL FEAR, a movie that helped guarantee her stardom.&#39;
b&#39;San Franpyscho: 1 out of 10: So you want to make a serial killer movie. But your budget is non-existent, your camera equipment is elderly and your stars are Joe Estevez (Martin Sheen\&#39;s younger brother and a staple in really bad movies) and Todd Bridges from Different Strokes. There are probably ways to pull of at least a watchable film. The Quiroz brothers have no clue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all much of the cast seems to have been chosen in a desperate attempt to make Bridges and Estevez look like Oscar caliber thespians. Really how hard is it to play a priest or an overbearing mother? Certainly a city the size of San Francisco has a few professional actors willing to work for a few bucks and a screen credit. Clearly Chris Angelo and Bonnie Steiger who play these roles have other talents such as landscaper or waitress they ought to be fine tuning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joe Rosete as the killer (yes the serial killer is simply known as &#34;The Killer&#34;) is also pretty awful in a mentally ill method kind of way but I am almost willing to give him the benefit of the doubt as his character is written with zero style or personality. A boring almost laughable serial killer is a problem for a serial killer movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition the Quiroz brothers seem to have originally planned this as an ABC Family movie of the week. There is no nudity or violence to speak of and the R rating clearly is for the adult style pacing. This move meanders like an 85 year old woman driving with wraparound sunglasses and her turn signal on. The only occasional horror comes from lighting Estevez\&#39;s face with a glare that makes it look like his lower jaw was removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn\&#39;t expecting a great film when I rented San Franpyscho but I wasn\&#39;t expecting mind numbing boredom either.&#39;
b&#39;This &#34;movie&#34; will give me nightmares, I will wake up drenched in sweat, screaming &#34;I didn\&#39;t make this film please don\&#39;t blame me!&#34; I honestly think it would have been more entertaining to watch a fat guy eating lard in his moms basement for a hour or two, than to watch this crap. I understand money was tight but goddamn what the hell were they thinking there was no thought, plot or effort put into this. This movie needs a warning &#34;Please for the love of god don\&#39;t fund the drama department a the local JC.&#34; On an other note these are the least likable characters I have ever seen, and I have seen movies with Hitler in them. So lastly take my advice the next time you even think about renting this just pop a few hundred Adivl and let the sleep come.&#39;
b&#39;After Loomis gives a quick recap of Micheal Myers we flashback to 1989 where Jamie is kidnapped by the Man in Black before the burning police station explodes. Micheal returns to Haddonfeild once again to find Jamie and his baby. In this version the Loomis character gets more scenes and seems much more pro-active than he is in the final cut. The Score is much better, more in line with parts 4 and 5, none of the electric guitar BS. And the ending makes a tad more sense. For these reasons coupled with the fact that this cut has more characterization and suspense, and cuts back on the gore factor (Halloween, unlike say the &#34;Friday the 13th&#34; Franschise, was never about blatant gore) is why I prefer this bootleg Producer\&#39;s cut. Not to say that the cut magically turns a turd into gold, it just polishes the turd a little bit and makes it more comprehensible. The whole cult plot is still very stupid, as is Micheal fathering a kid &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Producer\&#39;s Cut Grade: C- &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Theatrical Cut Grade: D-&#39;
b&#39;Ok let\&#39;s start with saying that when a dutch movie is bad, it\&#39;s REALLY BAD. Rarely something with a little bit of quality comes along(Lek, Karakter) here in holland but not often. Costa! is about 4 girls going to Spain to go on vacation, party, get drunk, get laid (u know the drill). It\&#39;s also about the world of Clubbers or Proppers. Pro\&#39;s who\&#39;re trying to lure the crowd into their club.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\&#39;m not sure how long it took to write the script, but i suspect somewhere between 15 minutes and 20 minutes because you\&#39;re watching a bunch of random scenes for 90 minutes long. Nothing, and i mean nothing is believable in this movie. It\&#39;s almost too riduculous for words what happens with the storyline. Suddenly the movie transforms into a sort of karate action thing. With a one-on-one fight with \&#39;the bad guy in black\&#39; and cliche car chase scenes trough a watertank-car (can it be more cheesy). Also the words character-development and casting are unfamiliar to the makers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After having seen &#34;Traffic&#34; 3 days before this, i fell from sheer brilliance, from a piece of art to this. This is film-making at it\&#39;s saddest. And don\&#39;t start about low budget. Because even with a low budget you could write a better script. It almost seems that the film-makers were too busy partying themselves to make a decent movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway the chicks in the water at the end made it up a little bit, but for the rest of it, don\&#39;t waste your money on such garbage.&#39;
b&#39;This movie was Jerry Bruckheimer\&#39;s idea to sell some records . No seriously it was . The thinking behind it is that if you made a film full of pop songs you could stick the tracks on a LP , sell it and make even more money for the studio . You could also release a few tracks as singles and intercut the promo video with clips from the movie so that when MTV play a track you\&#39;re actually getting free advertising for the movie . This is a good business deal but an artistic disaster because many of us still have nightmares about Hollywood movies from the 1980s and I rate the mid 1980s as the poorest time in artistic terms for American film making and FLASHDANCE opened the door to this &#34; Let\&#39;s make a 90 minute pop video instead of a movie &#34; type film making&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jennifer Beals plays Alex Owens a dancer who works as a welder to make ends meet and right away logic disappears with this career choice . Welding is a fairly sophisticated trade , it\&#39;s not something you walk into and learn in five minutes . There\&#39;s other gaps in logic like ballet dancing and &#34; flashdancing &#34; being somehow similar . ie if you apply to be a ballet dancer and do some hot , dirty flashdancing the male judges might want to meet you after the audition but you won\&#39;t get the job . it\&#39;s kind of like saying that screen writing , novel writing and play writing are somehow the same when they\&#39;re not &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I guess none of this mattered to Jerry when he asked director Adrian Lyne to make the movie . Actually Lyne almost makes a very sexy movie , JenniferBeals is very sweet and innocent looking . Fortunately I sussed out why her face is brightly lit in close up while her silhouette is darkly litin long shots except when the camera cuts to close ups of her heavenly toned body . That\&#39;s because a body double is used most of the time and frequently the body double is a man ! I bet there\&#39;s a few naughty boys who are feeling guilty not to mention slightly disgusted to know that&#39;
b&#39;It\&#39;s a Time Machine all right. It runs in &#34;real time&#34; for 96 minutes but it felt like 96 years. The first 20 minutes were utterly superfluous. Massive amounts of &#34;dead&#34; time throughout. What happened? When will something happen? Who cares? Apparently the film was made on a tight budget, I note for your edification the following: The Morlochs: nothing like saving a little money by reusing the sets and costumes from Lord of the Rings part I, hey? The &#34;scary dude&#34; in charge of controlling the Morlochs... The scariest thing these guys could think of was somebody wearing one of Gene Simmons: (of the band Kiss) old costumes??? Little-known fact: freaks of the future have perfectly manicured nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money, save your time. Pass on this one.&#39;
b&#39;The idea for the movie wasn\&#39;t too bad: a horror film shot in a corn maze on Halloween. The bad part was the shoddy camera work, the ten million shots of puddles and corn, and the hour and a half long walk this guy took in the maze. Oh, I\&#39;m sorry, the &#34;maize.&#34; I picked up this movie because it reminded me of a corn maze near where I live, and I thought it was a cool idea for a movie. But taking everything into consideration, it seems that your average Joe could take the same idea and run much further with it. Bill Cowell\&#39;s acting wasn\&#39;t too bad, in fact, I would say it was pretty good. But the lack of talent from his co-stars didn\&#39;t help his efforts. Here\&#39;s to hoping his next movie will be easier to swallow.&#39;
b&#39;Probably not the same version as most of the other reviewers because there`s no real hard core sex . What do people mean by hard core sex ? The sort of explicit hard core sex seen in films starring Traci Lords and &#34; Big &#34; John Holmes ? Well anyway this is really poor film , I doubt if I`ve ever seen so many big name actors wasted in a film . The script is really poor and plotless , the directing and cinematography is awful and the editing is non existant . It truly is an absolutely awful film. You could watch this ten times and still not understand what the hell it`s about . The only memorable scene is the one where people are buried up to their necks and a giant lawnmower comes along and decapitates them . Yes you read that right , a film set in Roman times has a scene with a head chopping giant lawnmower !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trivia point. Many years ago a pirate copy of THE THING ( 1982 version ) was doing the rental rounds on my Island and it been copied onto a rental tape of CALIGULA meaning the pirate version of THE THING starts with the first few seconds of CALIGULA of the man and woman walking through the forest then the title sequence of THE THING starts . This led people who`d seen the pirate tape to believe the forest scene was the opening of John Carpenter`s 1982 film and were very confused as to what it meant. Well that`s what you get for renting pirate videos . But having seen the whole of CALIGULA I don`t know what it meant either&#39;
b&#39;Everybody loves to see a really bad movie sometime. You watch it, take a good laughs and forget it in the next half hour. But this is not one of those. It\&#39;s the worst thing that will appear in front of your eyes for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to see someone to take responsibility for Dante - he\&#39;s really the most stupid villain you can think of: a guy in leather pants that speaks with a voice over and has a victory laugh like a 50\&#39;s Dracula. How can someone came up with this guy?? And the hero...&#34;The Dragon&#34; or whatever...my cereals box has better acting skills than him (maybe than all of them), it\&#39;s unbelievable. But the worst are the fighting scenes where you would think there could be something in it. They\&#39;re so lame, it\&#39;s beyond any kind of description. There\&#39;s no shame, i just can\&#39;t believe how this movie was allowed by any studio. But i\&#39;m just thrilled it was. Watching this is a self-mutilating pleasure. See this only if you\&#39;re in a movie quest for pain, and in that case, this one is a sure winner.&#39;
b&#34;Another direct to video movie from Disney, that is essentially perfect for the kids. The problem with Kronk&#39;s New Groove I find is that everything that made the first movie a fun great ride is replaced with a more sad and sombre film. In this movie, Kronk learns a great deal of lessons at many others&#39; expenses. It takes away much time that could be spent at creating a more enjoyable film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kronk&#39;s New Groove deals with two stories: Yzma returns for payback and one Ms. Birdwell hopes to defeat Kronk&#39;s camp counseling championship. This all leads up to Kronk confronting his father and his disapproval over his son&#39;s direction in life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Lord of the Rings to Michael Jackson&#39;s Thriller, Kronk&#39;s New Groove recycles every bit of time that it allows to entertain its viewers. If you loved the original, or are looking forward to the upcoming TV series about Kuzco, I recommend Kronk to his loyal fans.&#34;
b&#39;In the animated series: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aeon Flux was an amoral rebel that was completely detached from everything and everyone. She was cruel, selfish, loving, unpredictable, witty, caustic, confident, sarcastic, lethal, untamable, ambiguous all at once. The original Aeon had layers upon layers of depth. She almost never allowed her personal emotions to show through. The original plot was deliciously ambiguous and thought provoking. You could never tell what Aeon\&#39;s motives were. Aeon was a militant anarchist whereas Trevor was a radical idealist, because of this they could never have any semblance of a stable relationship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the movie:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aeon Flux works for the Monicans and her political motives and personal motives are very clear. She was pretty, loving, vulnerable, easily tamable, emotional and very predictable. The Aeon in the movie had one layer of depth at most. The plot was obvious and contrived. Everything is completely laid out for you from the beginning. There was virtually no conflict between Aeon and Trevor, at least in terms of personal philosophies. The only conflict between them was that they were on different sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie was a horrible disappointment to me. I felt betrayed. They took the idea of one of my favorite animated characters of all time, squeezed all the depth and personality out of her, and pumped her full of Hollywood clich\xc3\xa9s. The essence of the animated series was completely lost in this movie. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I\&#39;m not giving this movie a &#34;1&#34; is because the visuals were incredible. It was neat to see some of the familiar animated scenes like the fly in the eye done with CGI.&#39;
b&#39;This is just another one of those &#34;American finds romance with charming foreigner in exotic European locale.&#34; This genre has been cinematically bankrupt since the 1950s, yet they continue to churn them out. I let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this - bad idea, we both hated it. If all you want to see is Tuscany, try watching &#34;Stealing Beauty&#34; with Liv Tyler - a marginally better movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This types of genre movies are very Hallmark Greeting Card-ish.&#39;
b&#39;Forget any angst-ridden documentary! This film is really an out and out comedy about a 40-yer-old porn star whose goal in life is to sing junky circuit party songs. The only problem? Colton Ford can\&#39;t sing! And the film cuts away whenever he appears to be ready to burst into song. Yet Ford and equally vapid boyfriend Blake Harper whine and primp and run around in their tank tops, determined to make dreams come true. Even funnier is &#34;manager&#34; Kyle who appears to have the I.Q. of a turnip and whose collagen-injected lips look like a bee stung him. How can grown men be so self-delusional? Bwa ha ha! As for the documentary, the filmmakers don\&#39;t appear to have any POV and the film is poorly structured and wildly uneven. Very little background information is provided about the three leads. Such an inclusion might have made the three seem like something other than aging West Hollywood stereotypes.&#39;
b&#39;It\&#39;s the one film I almost walked out of, and would have if my friends hadn\&#39;t been in the movie theatre with me. Normally, even if I don\&#39;t like a film, I think it\&#39;s still worth sitting through it to the end. That way, you can really claim to have given it every chance to redeem itself. But with The Million Dollar Hotel, it was so dreadful I just badly wanted the experience to end as quickly as possible. I think I probably would not have been so sourly disappointed if this film had been made by a lesser director, one I didn\&#39;t normally like so much. But coming from Wenders, it was all the more shocking to behold. I know Bono from U2, a good friend of Wenders\&#39;s, wrote the script to this abysmal film, and I wonder why Wenders let him, as buddy-buddy as the two may have been. &#34;Stick to the day job, Bono&#34;, is a sentence that easily springs to mind whilst viewing this mess. Pretentious, disjointed, a mish-mash of every possible contemporary film stereotype, a naive and transparent attempt at coming across as kooky and daring, with the most irritating characters I have ever set eyes upon, especially the leads, Jeremy Davies, Milla Jovovich and Mel Gibson, none of whom I dislike normally. The happiest ending I could have wished for would have been for a nuclear bomb to be dropped on their collective heads so as to get it all over with as soon as possible. On a positive note, the first five minutes of the film are extremely good, with an extremely stirring soundtrack from U2. But the film\&#39;s opening shots make the rest of the film (which takes a spectacular nose-dive from then on) all the more disappointing as they are a promise of cinematic quality that\&#39;s just never delivered, not even close.&#39;
b&#39;It seems to be a common thing in the 90\&#39;s to play with cliches. Some manage to do so with great talent. Herv\xc3\xa9 Hadmar doesn\&#39;t. On the paper, the movie looked interesting though: the weak plot could have been saved by great moments of comedy, dark humour, and a very &#34;d\xc3\xa9cal\xc3\xa9&#34; style. Director Hadmar, unfortunately, kills his direction with his camera angles and his absolute lack of rhythm. Every joke is embarassing as no one reacts in the theater. The movie is incredibly slow, and the actors seem to be wondering what the hell they\&#39;re doing in this ridiculous mascarade. What could have been a stylish funny mindless comedy ends up being a cathedral of boredom.&#39;
b&#34;Wow, i just witnessed one of the greatest poker tragedies and I&#39;m not talking about the premature death of the great stu ungar. This film I&#39;m sorry to say was terrible. Absolutely terrible. A true tragedy in filmaking history. Well maybe I&#39;m being a little harsh but unless you have some interest in the life of stu ungar then don&#39;t even consider coming near this one. And those that do have an interest in his life will find that most parts were trivialised and made out to be great novelty scenes. I watched it because of Stu UNgar but nearly wanted to end myself like he did while watching this movie 4 stars for effort but unpleasantly painful&#34;
b&#34;Sadly this film lives up to about 1% of the hype that the game created in 2004 and leaves a very sour taste in the mouth. For video game enthusiasts, book worms and movie fans alike there is nothing more disappointing then a film that is based on an original concept (whether on paper or gaming console) that does not deliver. And not only that, goes well under the mark. Far Cry the video game released in 2004 created such a cult following that making a movie from the content should have been easy and scores of gamers would have flocked to watch the film. If you are a gamer that has played Far Cry; do not watch this film. Anyone else who hasn&#39;t played the game; it&#39;ll still seem like a B grade acted / B grade directed movie. Uwe Boll, hang your head in shame...this should&#39;ve been easy to make into a blockbuster. The storyline of the game was incredible (think Jurassic Park meets Alien) and yet you still managed to take it and mould it into your own terrible recreation of an instant classic. Video game companies be warned - if Uwe Boll comes a knockin&#39;, lock the door. Oh &amp; Til Schweiger...I look forward to seeing you make up for yourself in Inglourious Basterds. What were you thinking taking this one on? Sigh.&#34;
b&#39;As I write this in November 2005 I\&#39;ve become aware that the great British boom of cinema has come to an end and while people will claim much of this is down to the British government not giving film makers tax breaks I think the cause is much simpler - A lack of diversity on the part of producers over the last few years . Let\&#39;s have a look at what the Brits were producing 1995-2005:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Funky gangster thrillers . LOCK STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRALES was a truly great and thoroughly entertaining film and people went out of their way to ape Guy Ritchie\&#39;s style with usually disappointing results &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Romantic comedies . Yeah okay I do realise FOUR WEDDINGS , NOTTING HILL etc were produced by American studios but they\&#39;re still vaguely &#34; British films &#34; . Unfortunately because they\&#39;re guaranteed to make a profit for the studios they have to follow a winning formula which usually involved Hugh Grant playing Hugh Grant for the umpteenth time &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Black Comedies . Can anyone explain what a black comedy actually is ? In the British context it\&#39;s usually a rambling film with often contemporary political statements made and which often resembles Mike Leigh\&#39;s NAKED &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jasmin Disdar\&#39;s BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE is a good example of the third type of British movie . Filmed in 1999 but set in 1993 it opens with two men having a fight on a bus and it\&#39;s later revealed that one\&#39;s a Serb and one\&#39;s a Croat so we get a bite sized rundown of what was happening in the Balkans at that time , though what\&#39;s the odds of two former enemies in the Balkans bumping into each other on a London bus ? This sums up one of the major flaws of the movie - Irony takes precedence over likely situations , you can appreciate the final irony of the subplots but is the outcome likely ? Perhaps the greatest irony is the title of the film . It\&#39;s called BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE but certainly this audience member found them clich\xc3\xa9d stereotypical people that I couldn\&#39;t believe in as three dimensional characters&#39;
b&#34;All my friends and various other coworkers think this show is soooo great. First I hate this show!!!!!!! I think I might be the only female alive!!! I only watched it because my best friend adores it and fancies herself to be the Charlotte character!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First the whole plot (If you can call it that) is about four women Superslut Samantha (Kim Cattrall)who most likely has every STD available and mossy,brown and green genitals considering she is tri sexual( she&#39;ll try anything).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Samantha is not like most 40 something women even in NY, but than the show would not have some kind of entertainment since Samantha (along with some good NY scenery) is the only reason to watch and those are not reason enough. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charlotte (Kristen Davis) is a well dressed upper class NY idiot who still believes the Pince Charming myth! However sweet and pretty she is do not let that fool you, she spreads quite often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) now this woman is stereotypical angry, butch feminist. I think in one episode she is thought to be a lesbian, but apparently is not...What a shame she&#39;s almost interesting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) the most annoying character. I swear I thought I was watching Twisted Sister front man Dee Snider&#39;s more manly looking, cross dressing, sissy boy, brother! This is a girl looking for can&#39;t live without you love....Heard of a puppy?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This show is stupid and I love making fun of it because I hear about how it is some kind of new awakening for women. That is just sad if your looking to watch slutty, pathetic, addictive people in way too expensive clothes drinking cosmopolitans and sounding like an annoying 15 yr old on cocaine than there is a show for you............just use protection.&#34;
b&#34;Bad plot, bad acting, bad direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It had possibilities but just didn&#39;t achieve anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film looks like someone started with an idea, googled a bit of info and then tried to flesh an hour and a half with lots of night shots and bad suspense music.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others had to stop watching because they were scared 2/3 of the way through - I had to take a break purely because I just didn&#39;t care anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reminded me of an episode of Days of our Lives with marginally more suspense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just bad.&#34;
b&#39;It is a shame that such a great book was turned into such a terrible movie. I could not wait to see this movie after reading the book....it really did not do it justice.&#39;
b&#34;this movie wasn&#39;t good. i thought it&#39;d be a cute disney movie just like the original. wrong. it was awkward for christina ricci, whom i expect so much more than this, you could just tell by watching. i think doug e. doug did the best he could. sit 5 year olds in front of the this, any older, and they might start to fall asleep.&#34;
b&#39;I didn\&#39;t really HATE Mirrormask. I just really wanted more from a movie than pretty visuals. The movie begins with a young girl named Helana who works in a circus. But while other children (supposedly) want to run away to the circus she only wants to run away FROM the circus. During a heated argument with her mother, Helana wishes she would drop dead. Bad move. The mother gets ill with...something (presumably cancer) and needs surgery. On the night before surgery she dreams she travels to a wonderful world composed of her her dreams and nightmares where she &#34;finds herself&#34;. Personally the movie got crap for me as soon as she started dreaming. The early scenes show the weird and wonderful world of the circus and then contrast it with the bleakness of the hospital and the filth of an apartment block. But a soon as she dreams the whole films shifts to CGI land where nearly everything is a computer image. The problem is that this dream world has none of the mystery and wonder it should have. while films like the Wizard of Oz seemed enticing to explore Mirrormask shoves images in our faces and then snatches them away to give us another image. There\&#39;s little rhyme or reason to the design in this film and even though some things are very pretty (the librarian is a masterpiece) they just disappear so quickly that they\&#39;re soon forgotten. Helana and her sidekick Valentine are annoying at best and unbearable at worst. Overall Mirrormask is like a pretty stake that you bite and find out is actually ash. Stick to the real world kids.&#39;
b&#39;Kazuo Komizu, who hasn\&#39;t made one decent film, directed this &#34;notorious&#34; shocker and should be ashamed that it was a hit upon its Japanese release.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it does feature scenes of rape, gore and dismemberment, but so what? It has the style of a bad American porn film shot and badly photographed by Ed Powers (&#34;Dirty Debutantes&#34;) and is incredibly slow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to have earned its notoriety based on its roster of anti-social acts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a huge difference between this and horror that is well produced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just because someone likes their cinema a little wet does not mean they\&#39;ll accept crap like this. On the contrary, that kind of fan (myself, for example) tolerates even less crap than the average punter out there because he\&#39;s seen so much and has become overly discerning. It\&#39;s a shame production companies don\&#39;t realize that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One reviewer here (ZombieKilla81) commented that the film\&#39;s &#34;near obsession with gang rape&#34; is one of the factors that killed it. I disagree. The subject matter is never the issue. The issue is how that subject matter is treated. In ENTRAILS OF A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN, it is treated so unimaginatively that it is boring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I like graphic depictions of psychopathic behavior (with an intriguing context) if the material is well directed, freshly photographed and aesthetically pleasing. This Nikkatsu horror/pink hybrid is woeful.&#39;
b&#39;In this Silly Symphony, a mouse from the country visits his cousin in the city. Most of the short is the two mice exploring the dinner table. The animation is fine, where this short suffers is in a lack of humor. Perhaps I\&#39;ve just seen this &#34;dinner table adventure&#34; in one too many Tom and Jerry shorts. Even though this came first, I just didn\&#39;t find it that enjoyable.&#39;
b&#34;This picture hit the movie screens on June 6th 1980, starring Stephen Macht as Sergeant Thor, Avery Schreiber as Captain Comelius Butt, J.D. Hinton as Buzz and starring Playmate of the year Dorothy Stratton. The picture starts with the police infinity roaming space looking for I guess criminals. There ship is suddenly attacked by an unknown space ship. Enters Sergeant Thor and his partner Buzz as they try to figure out who the unknown ship belongs to. When failing they call on Captain Comelius who instructs his crew to fight back. Enters the gorgeous Dorothy Stratton, who plays the role of Galaxina who is man made robot. An now a few thoughts on this picture. This movie was plan stupid and it&#39;s one of the reasons that I don&#39;t get into Sci-Fi. If you&#39;re into Sci-Fi you would have notice that the laser sound effects were borrowed from an early Sci-fi movie titled Battlestar Galactica which aired in theaters in 1978. Many of the door sounds that you hear in this movie came from another Sci-Fi movie that aired back in 1966 titled Star Trek. Now for the reason that I bought this movie, Dorothy Stratton. She is gorgeous in her one piece suit. I think her talents were wasted in this picture and she should have never been involved in such garbage. Connie Sellecca was also considered for the role and her talents would have been wasted also. On the picture alone I give this movie 1 weasel star and on Dorothy Stratton I give her 10 weasel stars even though she didn&#39;t deserve to be put into a trash movie like this. If you like pictures like this you can get the DVD version on Amazon.com&#34;
b&#39;I am testing myself to watch 3 bad movies in a row to find out if watching 3 bad movies in a row could give me amnesia I have a dubbed to English version of this movie. Now let me go down the points Music Score: bad quality but at least it suits Story: it\&#39;s about a guy who goes to a town and he meets his sheriff brother and they fight for farmers land from a major and he allies with mexicans to drive them out and Trinity and his brother try to teach them to defend it - The final climatic fight scene will confuse anyone about who the #### are the good guys Conclusion: better than I thought but I need to continue with this I am next going to watch the Dolph Lungren and Jean-Claudde Vanne Damme movie &#34;Universal Soldier&#34; pray for my sanity&#39;
b&#39;Why, oh why, is this trash considered a classic? I\&#39;ve seen higher body counts on episodes of The Simpsons. Virtually nothing happens in this film and much of it\&#39;s running time is filled with nearly unbearable melodrama straight out of a low-rent soap opera.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Trenton family are going through tough times and when dad is away mommy and little boy go to get the car fixed. But when they get to the ranch they discover that the guard dog has gone mad. The rest of the film is just them sitting in the car while the slobbering St. Bernard circles them over and over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the kid, I have never, ever seen a more annoying child in a film in my life. And obviously he\&#39;s completely Aryan since blonde-haired and blue-eyed kids, such as the one prominently featured on packets of Kinder chocolate, are apparently more sympathetic than people with brown eyes and dark hair, like me. All he does is cry and whine. Same goes for mommy. She gets out the car, she gets in the car, she gets out the car, she gets in the car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this was made in 1983 but I just sick to death of horror films where the characters make stupid, illogical decisions. If mommy just used some common sense she\&#39;d be able to get away from the icky dog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s very poorly written and there\&#39;s zero tension. If you want to see a good &#34;bad dog&#34; movie then check out John Lafia\&#39;s Man\&#39;s Best Friend. It\&#39;s funny, inventive, has a better dog, a higher body count and a more involving story. Leave this garbage be.&#39;
b&#39;Some slack might be cut this movie due to the fact that it was made in 1979. That much said, it really is pretty dire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never mind the laughable back-projection or the awful, awful camera-tracking of supposed &#34;in-flight&#34; objects, it\&#39;s the stunts that the Concorde pulls off that will have you blinking in disbelief at the absurdity. Barrel-rolls, loop-the-loops and violent &#34;evasive&#34; maneuvers left me wondering why the Air-Forces of the world didn\&#39;t just fly Concordes as their main fighters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, here are the important lessons I learned from this celluloid cheese-fest: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The Concorde is at least as agile as a Phantom 4 jet-fighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. You can fire a flare gun at Mach 2 simply by opening the cockpit window and sticking your arm out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. If the flare gun fails to discharge, do not drop it, as it may then go off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. The Concorde can dodge up to two Sidewinder missiles fired at it at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. A flare will distract a heat-seeking missile every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Switching off your jet-engines is a sure-fire way of throwing heat-seeking missiles off track if 5 (above) fails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. When performing a crash-landing in the Concorde, it is apparently impossible to jettison your fuel beforehand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. Concorde pilots are all combat-trained veterans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you might imagine, this film is not very realistic. The effects are primitive by today\&#39;s standards and that, coupled with the nonsense acrobatics the Concorde performs, makes this a movie deserving of little but scorn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not recommended. Not recommended at all!&#39;
b&#34;Visually, this film is interesting. Light is literally thrown in a way, together with cinematography and an alluring introduction before the titles, that had my hopes up at the start, but then - a b-movie is a b-movie is a b-movie, no matter how much spectacle is seen. This film surrounds the life of Albert Fish, one of the most well-known serial-killers in the world. Active around the start of the 20th century, Fish&#39;s life is hastily and blurry dealt with before before he started killing children at an old age. This film is based upon two tracks: Fish&#39;s life and that of William F. King, lead investigator of the case. What saves this film from becoming a Hallmark spectacle and debacle of the usual sort, whenever films about serial killers are concerned, is the direction, which is a double-edged sword; director Scott L. Flynn sheds focus enough upon the b-actors not to let their flaws shine through too much, but at the same times created a truly dull and stereotypical view of the American police through the King-angle. Sure enough he dealt quite thoroughly with Fish&#39;s meet with Grace Budd, the 10-year-old girl that he killed, even though I&#39;m not really sure if her mother was the media-crazed person that Flynn really tries to emphasise that she was. I miss more psychological diving into Fish, not to mention the very little time which was spent on Fish&#39;s post-capture. All in all, interesting for those who are into serial-killers, but mostly a let-down; however, if the director will make another film about another serial-killer, I&#39;d definitely see it in hopes that holes were patched-up.&#34;
b&#39;The quote above just about says it all for &#34;Slipstream&#34;. I should have bailed out of this film after the first half hour, but decided I ought to be fair and give it a chance. I won\&#39;t watch it again, so if anyone with the temerity to do so can get back to me with the number of clich\xc3\xa9d lines in the movie, I\&#39;m sure it will set a record.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some otherwise fine and talented actors got mixed up with this clunker; Mark Hamill portrays a futuristic bounty hunter and Bill Paxton is his quarry. Paxton\&#39;s character has hijacked Hamill\&#39;s prisoner, an android taking his name from the poet Byron (Bob Peck). Tasker (Hamill) shoots Owens (Paxton) with a dart containing a tracking device so he and his companion Belitski (Kitty Aldridge) can keep tabs on the pair. The real question though is why didn\&#39;t he just fire the device at Byron thereby cutting out the middleman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you enjoy scene after disjointed scene with tedious characterization and artsy fartsy pretense, then I suppose you\&#39;ll find something of interest here. But you can\&#39;t convince me that the film makes sense on any level. Scenes of a futuristic Stone Age make way for high society snobbery, but the pinnacle of poor taste is reached when Paxton\&#39;s character is displayed following a night of revelry with hickeys all over his torso. If anyone thinks there\&#39;s some hidden meaning here, you\&#39;re really stretching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Patiently waiting for the frame proclaiming &#34;The End&#34; to come into view, alas, even that was denied. If beauty is in the eye of the beholder, then so is understanding; this movie had neither. Yet there was a single redeeming feature as the closing credits began their run - an awesome view of a half dozen hot air balloons. Apparently the film was keeping them afloat.&#39;
b&#34;Awful! Awful! Awful! Drab, unimaginative, predictable - and with all the usual suspects. Exactly the sort of film the Irish Film industry shouldn&#39;t be making. And with the added bonus of a treacle-coated ending. A sickening example of how talent &amp; originality is by-passed in favour of an almost aggressive mediocrity. Yes - the children are sweet. Yes - it almost looks like it&#39;s done professionally. But this is film making by numbers, a direct smash and grab on what the director obviously thinks is &#39;success&#39; - a film which patronises and despises the audience. It&#39;s quite amazing that Working Title would pour \xc2\xa33m into this rubbish. But then, they paid for Love Actually. Don&#39;t waste your money.&#34;
b&#34;This movie had very few moments of real drama. After the opening minutes the film descended in a spiral that didn&#39;t quite take us to hell and back - viewing was pure purgatory to say the least. The acting was more horrendous than the subject matter of the film and at times I couldn&#39;t stop laughing. The continuity between some of the scenes was dire - characters disappeared from scenes without explanation only to be replaced by other characters who minutes earlier had been some where else. Surely this was a spoof of The Exorcist. The collection plate at the church must have been full of copper the day Mr Russo signed up for this one. Do I speak Latin? Et tu Brutus.&#34;
b&#34;one of the most awaited movie!i thought himesh will do a bit of acting but Alas all my hope went wrong..given that the heroine is 15 yrs old!!!!omg!!what did they thought before considering the actress..may be its because no boby wants to work with HR(as he is called in the film,(human resource as many people wrote in mazagines!)nevertheless it was a disappointment.i hope the producer doesn&#39;t make himself bankrupt by making a part 2 of this as this news is roaming around...the story was predictable one with himesh showing his generosity character throughout the movie which i doubt very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;anyways..the movie is good from those people&#39;s angle who thinks himesh cant do anything wrong. &gt;&gt;4 out of 10&lt;&lt;&#34;
b&#34;Critters 4 starts, &amp; I quote &#39;Somewhere in Kansas 1992&#39; &amp; a replay of the last few minutes of Critters 3 (1991) as the recurring character of Charlie McFadden (Don Keith Opper) is about to shoot the last two remaining Critter eggs in the universe which, we are informed, would mean the extinction of the entire Critter race which is against some sort of intergalactic zoological law or something like that. Charlie&#39;s bounty hunter friend Ug (Terrence Mann) is now known as Counsellor Tetra &amp; is a top ranking official at the intergalactic council &amp; orders Charlie not to shoot the eggs but instead put them into a pod that will land nearby very soon, the pod does indeed land nearby very quickly &amp; Charlie does indeed put the eggs into it but he is also caught in the pod which I presume cryogenic-ally freezes him as it&#39;s never really explained. Critters 4 then informs us that we are &#39;Somewhere in Saturn Quadrant 2045&#39; where a salvage ship comes across the pod drifting in space (the credits have barely finished &amp; Critters 4 is already stealing entire ideas &amp; scenes from Aliens (1986)). Rick (Anders Hove) decides to claim the unidentified, to them anyway, pod &amp; try &amp; make a bit of cash out of it. With the help of his crew, Ethan (Paul Whitthorne), Fran (Angela Bassett), Al Bert (Brad Dourif) &amp; Bernie (Eric DeRe) the pod is successfully recovered. They get in touch with the intergalactic council &amp; Counsellor Tetra say to go to an abandoned space-station where a trade will be made for the pod &amp; it&#39;s contents, Tetra also specifically tells Rick not to open the pod. So in true horror film tradition Rick opens the pod, thaws Charlie out &amp; the Critter eggs which hatch, kill Rick &amp; escape into the space-station...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Co-produced &amp; directed by Rupert Harvey I thought Critters 4 was a pretty useless film &amp; rounds the Critter series of films off with a whimper rather than a bang. The script by Joseph Lyle &amp; David J. Schow is both predictable &amp; clich\xc3\xa9d, the space-station with an unstable reactor that will blow up in a few hours, the protagonists only means of escape being neutralised early on so they are stuck, the race against time to save themselves, the constant bickering &amp; arguing amongst the crew, people splitting up &amp; the loser who turns into a hero &amp; saves the day, yawn. A lot of plot devices seem to come straight from Aliens &amp; it rips off Star Wars (1979) with a tacky waste compactor scene. The characters are no better &amp; you probably won&#39;t give a damn about any of them. While the other Critter films could be described as comedy horrors part 4 cannot, it appears to be deadly serious throughout. Critters 4 is also incredibly slow, uneventful &amp; dull. It&#39;s over 30 minutes before the Critter eggs hatch &amp; after this brief sequence it&#39;s nearly the hour mark before their seen again, why make a Critter film &amp; barely feature them? It can&#39;t be because of the expensive special effects as they look like glove puppets anyway, oh &amp; how can a mere hours old Critter operate an entire space-station &amp; set a course for Earth? How do they even know what Earth is? Why did Capatin Rick want to open the pod anyway? What is all that stuff about with the female scientist &amp; a rubber alien thing that is mentioned only once? Why do the intergalactic council want the Critters so badly? Why only send four men? Why is this perfectly good looking space-station totally deserted again? Critters 4 looks cheap throughout with bland, dark unimaginative sets &amp; it even steals footage from Android (1983) for it&#39;s ships &amp; space scenes, Critters 4 was apparently so low budget that the filmmakers couldn&#39;t afford any optical effects &amp; the ones it takes from Android look seriously dated. For the most part only two Critters are used although some-more start to hatch but it&#39;s pretty late in the day when this happens, for most of the film they are barely seen &amp; the effects for them are the worst of the entire series. Forget about any blood or gore as the Critters only kill two people during the 90 plus minute running time which just wasn&#39;t enough to maintain my waining interest. The acting is pretty poor as well with Angela Bassett&#39;s over-the-top melodramatic reaction to seeing a few Critter eggs particularly cringe worthy. To look at Critters 4 it is as cheap &amp; unspectacular a production as you could hope to (not) see. The ending of Critters 4 has the universe finally being saved form the Critter menace, lets hope it also saves us &amp; our local video-stores from the menace of a part 5...&#34;
b&#39;In &#34;Red Letters&#34;, Coyote is at the vortex of as a college professor who writes to a female prison inmate and gets more than he bargained for. There are two reasons to watch this flick...Kinski is one and Piven the other although it\&#39;s difficult for their sparks to shine in such a complete directorial disaster. Everything is wrong with &#34;Red Letters&#34;...convoluted, lousy screenplay, camera, editing, and most of all acting which is subpar for Coyote, etc. Battersby has taken a story with potential and turned it into a seriously flawed and amateurish flick not worth the time.&#39;
b&#39;Considering the subject matter, I thought that this film would at least be enjoyable, if stopping somewhat short of a masterpiece. I was wrong. I was still waiting for something to happen and it finished - I thought that the finale was the bit that happened before it got exciting. The only reason I gave it 2 instead of 1 is because the effects guys deserve some recognition.&#39;
b&#39;SPOILERS: The original Road House is one of those movies that I know is clich\xc3\xa9d and unoriginal, yet it\&#39;s done so well, I\&#39;m embarrassed to admit I really like it. Turns out many of my friends, whose movie opinions I respect, think the same way. So when they attempt to make a sequel to it and it\&#39;s as if it was written by some high school kids who were given the rights to do a sequel, it\&#39;s just bad; really, really bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oddly, Johnathon Schaech is listed as one of the writers and I can only hope his WGA membership is revoked. The writing was just bad and all the writers of this film should retire for complete lack of originality and some of the worst dialog in this millennium. Schaech already appearing to be the king of the straight-to-DVD sequel (8mm 2, Poison Ivy 2) and now after seeing this and 8mm 2, I\&#39;m thinking his acting ability is non-existent. He was awful, just awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it\&#39;s not the terrible fighting scenes that make this movie terrible, but take it from me, they\&#39;re bad. Every fight scene is a slowly delivered punch (yet still making the &#34;wiff&#34; sound in the air) that is then blocked by the opponent, who returns a punch that sends the first guy to the ground. This is repeated throughout the film, worse than any bad 1970s cop show. Or the fact that many of the people involved in the fights seem to have a mouth full of cherry kool-aid for some reason. And we\&#39;re supposed to believe Will Patton is a fighting machine; his fight scenes look so amazingly fake I was honestly embarrassed watching. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s the complete lapses of logic in this ridiculous movie that make it terrible. For instance: Johnathon Schaech\&#39;s character is in town for a day and already tells some girl he barely knows who he has no idea what side she\&#39;s on, &#34;I\&#39;m with the Feds, but don\&#39;t tell anyone.&#34; The female villain, who fights the good girl in one fight scene with acrobatics that rival any super hero, yet is easily held down by the Will Patton, &#34;old guy,&#34; in another scene by simply holding both her hands while he utters some ridiculous line (&#34;stab me once, shame on you, stab me twice, ain\&#39;t gonna happen&#34; whew, that\&#39;s bad) and then head-butts her. Jake Busey\&#39;s villain shoots at the feds while caught in the middle of a drug deal, yet no DEA agents or anyone simply go to his place and pick him up after, in fact, he\&#39;s simply let go because &#34;this is the sheriff\&#39;s territory.&#34; Busey wants the bar because it\&#39;s &#34;in a great location&#34; for drug deals, yet his own house appears to be just as good apparently offering all the perks the bar is supposed to have. Johnathon Schaech\&#39;s character is supposed to be the son of Patrick Swayze\&#39;s character in the original, yet Swayze\&#39;s character\&#39;s last name is Dalton and Schaech\&#39;s isn\&#39;t (nor is the supposed brother of Swayze\&#39;s character). And Johnathon Schaech looks about 50 in this movie. I looked it up, he\&#39;s 17 years younger than Swayze, but he looks awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But my favorite absolutely stupid scene in this movie was the most stock fight scene ending in movies: the villain is knocked through a window on a second floor and as they pan down I\&#39;m thinking &#34;please don\&#39;t tell me he\&#39;s impaled on something...&#34; and sure enough, my worst fears were realized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, I could go on for another half hour about the things I hated about this movie. Suffice to say, let\&#39;s put an end to these ridiculous straight-to-DVD sequels to theatrical movies, at least the ones with Johnathon Schaech.&#39;
b&#34;i recently went to a free screening of soap girl where the filmmakers were present. before the movie they strutted around, laughing, taking pictures. i was excited to see them dressed up in real life, and couldn&#39;t wait to see the movie on the big screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;during the movie, the audience errupted with laughter. it was clear to me then that they weren&#39;t laughing with the picture, but at the picture. this is purely a grade B movie with no logic behind it. throw in some nudity, some blood and whala! you have a movie!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;after the movie i approached a bunch of the filmmakers and asked them why they wanted to make this movie. they all acted so serious, like they were serious filmmakers. they each told me something different: to make a controversial movie, a funny movie, an uplifting movie, a socially responsible movie. everybody mentioned something different. it was clear to me that none of the filmmakers knew what kind of movie they were making, and they were now trying to recoup their money by publicizing this movie any way they could to get people to see it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me warn you: don&#39;t buy into the hype! unless you seriously have nothing else to do, it might be worth a film student&#39;s time to study how a film should not be made. otherwise you are better off saving two hours of your life.&#34;
b&#39;When I was 13 or so I was lucky enough to find this film. It was part of an endless Danish series of really cheesy stuff. This however was the cheesiest I ever owned - but I guess I sold it, too bad. Well what to write... Better than &#34;Manos: the hands of fate&#34; and worse than &#34;Critters 4&#34;. But it\&#39;s definitely worth an hour and a half since this was made by people who wanted to make it. The acting isn\&#39;t that terrible compared to several other eighties trash - in fact I kind of like the old man even though he did\&#39;NWT look that Indian to me. But I guess you can\&#39;t have everything... Do yourselves a favour and look this up...&#39;
b&#34;I will commend it in only one respect.. it was innovative. Innovative doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a good film, it means that it can give you an idea of what you can take and implement in your own films.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The simple plot is.. well.. simple. I got to the point where I didn&#39;t care if they destroy the building or not. If I had to hear that girl&#39;s annoying giggle one more time, I swear I would hurl the DVD out the window. And there&#39;s also the protagonist. They try to make him lovable, but he&#39;s a freakin pervert! Sniffing the girls bra, sneaking peeks at her when she&#39;s naked, putting her bra over his eyes when he sleeps, putting her bra on a blow up sex doll (which she takes her panties off while hes asleep and slips them on his doll.. umm)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What irritates me even moreso is that crappy tinting. In the photo gallery on the DVD, you can see what the film looked liek before they greyscaled it and put in a color tint (digitally too).. The film looked a LOT better without the effect.. so they sacrificed it being a good film just to be artsy... bah. I could understand using gimmicks like that if the film quality was crap..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think most people who liked this film just liked it because the chick was naked for a good 5 - 10 minutes. This doesn&#39;t compare to Delicatessen ( like so many are tryign to do). Delicatessen has characters you can get into and like.. these people here just grunt and giggle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I would also liek to point out that this was also tryign to be like a German Impressionistic film liek the old silents. One of the problems with most foreign, especially artsy, films is that thety focus on making an artsy composition and forget about the &#39;space&#39; of the scene. It results in the audience not really understanding what;s going on because they don&#39;t get a sense of the space of the surroundings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it&#39;s rubbish. The short film on the DVD, Surprise, was a heckuva lot better.&#34;
b&#39;There is a reason Chairman of the Board got a 2, (which is too high) this movie flat out is one of the worse movies of all time and I seen my share of rotten films. Chairman of the Board stars two of the most annoying actors/people today, Carrot Top and Courtney Thorne Smith. Carrot Top just isn\&#39;t funny anymore and wasn\&#39;t in this piece of trash. Courtney Thorne Smith isn\&#39;t any better, just watch &#34;According To Jim&#34; and you will see a prime example of what I am talking about. Chairman of the Board got a 1 from me, because that is low as you can go it is that bad. I am a little shocked that this piece of junk isn\&#39;t on the IMdb bottom 100 somewhere, I would put this in the top 5 on that list, but its slowly working its way there.&#39;
b&#34;DIRTY WAR &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aspect ratio: 1.78:1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sound format: Stereo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emergency services struggle to cope when Islamic terrorists detonate a so-called &#39;dirty bomb&#39; in the middle of London.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daniel Percival&#39;s frightening movie uses all available evidence to dramatize the possible effects of a radioactive explosion in the heart of the UK capital, using the kind of documentary-style realism which has distinguished this particular subgenre since the 1960&#39;s. In essence, the film reveals a catalogue of flaws in the British government&#39;s current strategy for dealing with such terrorist outrages, and Percival&#39;s carefully-honed script (co-written by Lizzie Mickery) vents its spleen against mealy-mouthed politicians who would rather maintain the economic status quo than tackle this issue head-on. The film covers all necessary bases, and makes the salient point that this kind of terrorism is practised by a tiny handful of fanatics who have tarnished the Islamic faith with their reckless disregard for human life, though viewers won&#39;t be reassured by the subsequent scenes of devastation and horror. Not merely a drama, the film acts as a warning against complacency. Either that, or its just another post-9/11 scaremongering tactic. YOU be the judge...&#34;
b&#39;Man kills bear. Man becomes bear. Man/bear meets bear. Man/bear stays man/bear after meeting bear. The End. Seriously, that is the entire plot to this movie. Yes, I simplified it to an extreme, but you get the picture. I just wish I maybe had not have seen it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \&#39;man/bear\&#39; alluded to is a Native American Indian that kills a mother of a cub. And while that can be touching, it certainly lacks to really draw in on the potential conflict between the two parties. Plus, there was a certain misuse of the two moose in the film. But that is beyond the point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very much under par. Certainly needed a lot more to be entertaining. Maybe more laughs from the secondary characters and more drama between the two main bears. Thats what separates bad films from the good ones. &#34;D&#34;&#39;
b&#39;Boring as hell and kind of a chick flick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s the story of a neurotic woman who struggles with the concept of marriage as a business arrangement, the romantic nature of a one night stand, and the uncertainty and pitfalls of true love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many of the story\&#39;s motifs are reminiscent of other recent KST movies (e.g. the English Patient), but have far less appeal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first half-hour I started checking my watch, wondering if I\&#39;d make it home in time to catch Leno on tv.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I passed up &#34;Gladiator&#34; to see this!?!&#39;
b&#39;First of all let us discuss about the story. It is a copy of the movie &#34;Hitch&#34; with an added Indian Flavor to it. One guy, who is a Love guru, and another man who is seemingly a sucker when it comes to ladies, and how this seemingly sucker becomes a charmer with the help of the love guru forms the story. Salman Khan is the love guru, and Govinda is the lame guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now coming to artists\&#39; performance, Salman Khan overacts throughout the movie, he tries to be funny, but fails big time. You can see Salman shouting throughout the movie, no real acting is seen in his performance. Govinda pairs opposite Katrina Kaif(Oh, my god, she is one heck of a girl. A real Beauty)is in real life a 50 year old dude, and Katrina is a girl in her early twenties. In the movie Govinda looks like Grandpa of Katrina Kaif. What a pity! Coming to Execution of the movie. This movie feels like a B-Movie, and a poor imitation of the movie Hitch. Where Hitch looks like a movie with a purpose and depth, this movie is shallow and purposeless, nowhere there is justification or clarity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just forget this movie, for it is nothing but boring, typical Bollywood fare. Actually I give 3/10 because this is the lowest I go.&#39;
b&#39;The movie is powerful as a political statement about extraordinary rendition, torture and the politics of the war on terror. Others have already commented on these and other aspects of the movie. My review may contain spoilers, so if you haven\&#39;t seen the movie, you may not want to read beyond this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several questions are raised by this movie. First of all, was the protagonist guilty or not? There is no satisfying explanation for why the NSA decided to have him picked up and rendered in the first place. Is there an innocent explanation for why he got phone calls from what the NSA thinks is a terrorist? If there is, the movie does not seem to give one and that made the whole movie quite unsatisfying to me. It is all well and good to make statements about whether torture is right or wrong, but first prove to me that they tortured the wrong person, then we will take it to the next step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the protagonist was guilty, then what was achieved by releasing him? Perhaps, we was well-trained to resist up to a certain point and then pretend to break down and give answers that can be proved wrong with a little research, thus tending to lead the torturers to believe that they had tortured an innocent man into confessing without actually being guilty. However, there is nothing in the movie that proves he is guilty either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The various other loose ends out there are: 1. So, a rogue CIA agent has him released and flown back home. What prevents the NSA from picking him up again? A little publicity in the Washington Post? Please give me a break here... If a senator is not willing to put his neck on the line to intervene on his behalf, what does Corinne Whitman have to fear? 2. If the NSA has been tracking what phone numbers are being called by whom, why couldn\&#39;t they listen in on some of the calls to figure out whether anything underhanded is being discussed? 3. The plot is even more stupid anyways. Any criminal with more than a dozen brain cells would transact his criminal business on an anonymous prepaid cell phone line, not on one that can be traced back to him and his house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole movie revolves around tugging at the viewers\&#39; heart strings by showing graphic and gratuitous scenes of torture. But when you think about it with any more depth, there is nothing of substance in this movie, only plenty of unanswered questions and the feeling of &#34;what, that is it?!!!&#34; at the end of the movie.&#39;
b&#39;Victor Jory never became a major star. He is better known for later character roles than for his early leads. But he was very handsome and an excellent actor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His love scenes with Loretta Young in this romantic adventure thriller are passionate. Their kisses look very real. And very modern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vivienne Osborne is a standout here also. She plays a woman with a reputation. But the character has a good heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The print I saw was not clear. But what a joy that rare movies like this are turning up! And they are, in some sort of watchable condition, still intact. This is nothing truly special. But if one is willing to sift through movies of its era with similarly intriguing titles, one is likely to find some suprtb movies.&#39;
b&#39;This movie is simply rubbish. I have to say I am an expert of rubbish movies. I reserve the &#34;1&#34; rating for movies that are rubbish but funny, but this film is just tedious and certainly not crappy in a funny way but crappy in a crappy way. It gets a &#34;2&#34; so those of you out there can distinguish between the ones that will make you laugh and the ones that will make you fall asleep. There are scenes in this movie where the actors are looking at something, their expressions are of amazement and there wide eyes and slack jaws tell the audience that what they are looking at is going to be profoundly amazing, this simply isn\&#39;t it\&#39;s just a cupboard or even more desert. It has to be pretty god damn awful for me to walk out, let me tell you, I walked out and so did quite a few people.&#39;
b&#34;Formula movie about the illegitimate son of a rich Chilenian who stands to inherit a fortune and gets mixed up in the affairs of bad guys and falls in love with a beautiful female lawyer (Vargas). It looks very much like a TV movie, not really exciting. The only reason I bothered to see it was because Valentina Vargas was in it. No real surprises here, though it is nice to see Vargas. Great looking Chilenian landscapes on display but Malcolm McDowell&#39;s part is very small and doesn&#39;t add much to the movie. Michael Ironside plays as usual a bad guy but this is not one of his most memorable parts. The chase scenes are standard fare.&#34;
b&#39;This is without question one of the worst movies I have ever seen. However, it is also one of the most unintentionally hilarious. I like to compare it to Plan 9, in that it can be so bad, so awful,so dumb, and such a waste of time that I find myself laughing out loud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my biggest problems with it is that it\&#39;s a complete ripoff of Robin Hood, and let be honest and say that I love Robin Hood with Errol Flynn, and Robin Hood: Men in Tights. But let\&#39;s face it, from the forbidden love between Peck (who is definitely slumming it. Although in all fairness this was still a good few years before the masterpiece To Kill a Mockingbird) and the female character (who is so forgettable, apparently, that I have forgotten her name.), to the final scene where the good guys dress up as monks to fool the bad guys screams &#34;ROBIN HOOD&#34; all over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I don\&#39;t think the film isn\&#39;t worth seeing. On the contrary, I think that this is one of the funniest movies I\&#39;ve seen in years, even if it was unintentional.&#39;
b&#34;Eaten Alive follows a young woman (Janet Agren) who searches for her lost sister. Turns out her sister have joined a sect that has disappeared into the jungles of Borneo. With Vietnam veteran Mark at her side she sets off to find her sister.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As per usual, the acting isn&#39;t of the highest quality but you do get cannibal flick poster girl Me Me Lai spending most of the time on screen with her breast bare, female lead Janet Agren covered in gold paint and abused with a dildo dipped in snake blood among other things. Now that&#39;s gotta count for something! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, I must say that I find it bit hard to recommend this title. If you are fan of the genre, you will most likely recognize every gore scene in the movie bar a select few. And I mean that literally. A lot of the gore scenes are lifted straight out other Cannibal movies, like MAN FROM DEEP RIVER and LAST CANNIBAL WORLD. There&#39;s probably more movies stuck in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, this is one for die-hard fans to check off their list. If you haven&#39;t seen any Italian jungle movies, you&#39;d be better off watching CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST and if you&#39;re an avid fan, you have seen most of the gore scenes in other movies.&#34;
b&#39;I have read and enjoyed many of James Lee Burke\&#39;s Robicheaux mysteries. When I read \&#39;In The Electric Mist With The Confederate Dead\&#39; was being filmed and Tommy Lee Jones was playing the lead, I was thrilled. After watching it last night, I ending up turning it off with about twenty minutes left, not wanting to see any more people shot or beaten up. Don\&#39;t get me wrong, I don\&#39;t mind blood and gore-I love \&#39;The Untouchables\&#39; and \&#39;The Godfather Trilogy\&#39;. Perhaps it was just that I had previously seen \&#39;Birth\&#39; and \&#39;What Just Happened\&#39; before watching this. I know that Burke\&#39;s books are violent, lyrical, and especially in the case of \&#39;In The Electric Mist\&#39;, can be like the Cajun swamps he writes about, full of things that are never fully explained. In a book, that\&#39;s fine. In a film, that\&#39;s confusing. Many of the previous reviewers are also ardent admirers of Dave Robicheaux, which makes it more understandable that they really liked the movie. Or they are admirers of Bernard Tavernier or both. Even as a fan of all the actors (and especially Vince), I felt it was such a waste of their talents overall-they gave good performances in a film that didn\&#39;t hold together. Now, I say this, having only seen the USA DVD and hoping that Tavernier\&#39;s cut will make a huge difference. On the plus side: The soundtrack was wonderful. The scenes at Robicheaux\&#39;s place were perfect-just as I imagined the bait shop to look like. Mary Steenburgen was excellent as Bootsie, as was Walter Breaux as Batist. If you read the books, you know why Robicheaux is an even-tempered person in the beginning of the film, and then starts whacking people with various instruments. Overall, I wish that they had filmed more of the \&#39;Electric Mist and the Confederate Dead\&#39; and left out large portions of Robicheaux\&#39;s methods of interrogation, explaining Elrod\&#39;s gifts and his bond to Dave, as well as Dave\&#39;s to the General. Then I wouldn\&#39;t be feeling today as I did last night when I turned it off, &#34;What just happened?&#34;&#39;
b&#39;As a geology student this movie depicts the ignorance of Hollywood. In the scene where the dog grabs the bone from inside of the burning house, it is less then a foot from lava which has an average temperature of 1,750 degrees Fahrenheit. This stupidity is witnessed again when &#34;Stan&#34; goes to save subway 4. His shoes are melting to the floor of the subway while the rest of the team is standing just feet away from the flowing lava. And to finish off this monstrosity of a film, they come up with the most illogical solution, stopping a lava flow with cement K rails. Earlier in the film a reporters voice can be heard saying that nothing can stop the flow fire fighters have tried cars and CEMENT. Common sense dictates this film is a preposterous and gross understatement of human knowledge.&#39;
b&#34;In all the episodes, I never saw any real action or drama or comedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot is so repetitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****Somebody gets something old and then somebody else tells them a little bit about it and how much it&#39;s worth and who made it and where it comes from and how much it could sell for and if there was any work done to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sowhile I watched about 30 of these, i realized...there is no drama....nobody ever loses a limb or life or gets divorced or hit by a car or air-plane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are no car chases or explosions- not even a horse race with old carriages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All those guns and swords and nobody goes on a violent killing spree...what gives? No pshycos, no axe-murders, no-gun-totting old Englishmen in bad suits...just yap yap yap...you have an old tea set and it came from the country of Germany back in 1602 - blah blah blah...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m still waiting for somebody with a time machine to go on screen and ask about it, but no...it never comes to be and the only thing that happens is that some stuffy Englishman or woman serves up some crap about something old being sold in Boston or China during the Ming Dynasty - big EFFIN deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#39;t anybody ever kidnap one of the leads and hold them for ransom? Is there no alien spacecraft that will obliterate the entire floor? Who the hell writes this stuff as a series and expects us to stay awake? This is about as entertaining as watching paint dry - only with commentary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#39;s no sex, there&#39;s no comedy or romance, no action, no suspense, no action, no drama, no mystery or martial arts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This show sucks! What ever happened to supermodels wearing thongs and spewing lasers from a futuristic weapon? Antiques Roadshow - More like grab a blanket and pillow and go to sleep show...&#34;
b&#39;Movies like this make me wonder what modern horror would be like if someone had (mercifully, for movie fans) put an end to M. Night Shyamalan inside the womb. This garbage is a prime example of what kind of lame, random, uninspired, last minute, generic plot twists have become the norm since movies like &#34;The Sixth Sense&#34; and &#34;The Others&#34; were released. This was an okay movie until the writers took a dump all over whatever of the mediocre script they had written, and decided, &#34;Hey, here\&#39;s an interesting idea: Lets throw in a wacky twist at the end and make the main character the murderer! That\&#39;ll throw the audience for a loop!&#34; What an original idea.&#39;
b&#34;If this is classed as &#39;real life&#39; of London, then the producers must be on different planet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is the most depressing, suicidal, dark, dingy, dross on TV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone is fighting, everything has nasty under tones running through it, nothing is done for genuine reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a real life picture of people in London or the UK, then this programme is by the farthest from reality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is not one good word I can say about this programme. The only certainty is that will be a great big fight over Christmas dinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even the characters are totally unbelievable!&#34;
b&#39;Woody Allen (who I have to confess at the outset I have never been a big fan of) directed this quasi-documentary about the life of Emmett Ray (Sean Penn), a 1930\&#39;s jazz guitarist whose star apparently shone for a while, then quickly faded. Penn does a credible job in the role, portraying a complicated and somewhat neurotic man (not unlike Allen himself, which perhaps explains why Woody would be attracted to this project) who can\&#39;t maintain relationships, and whose twin passions (aside from guitar playing) were shooting rats at the dump and watching trains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There isn\&#39;t a great deal of consistency to the story. It\&#39;s narrated in a sense by a series of modern-day jazz &#34;experts&#34; (one of whom is Allen himself), who relate their various theories and interpretations of different events in Ray\&#39;s life. The end result is a wildly inconsistent account of the life of a fictional man who seems to have been given a fairly interesting life story by his creators, who probably should have done a better job with it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jazz fans and fans of Woody Allen will probably enjoy this. As for me? The best I can give it is a 3/10.&#39;
b&#39;The plot outline of this movie is similar to the original. Someone gets kidnapped, the prince is incest with saving her, Odet turns into a Swan, the turtle/frog/puffin first the &#34;bad&#34; magician as best they can, and in the end.... Anyways, there is not much new here. With the exception of a lack of well known voice talent. Sorry, no Palance nor Cleese and thus Jean-Bob was a disapointment.&#39;
b&#34;This film was okay, but like most TV series it would of been better if it just made for television. The best and most loved characters only had five minute roles, whilst the three mediocre characters were all the way through the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike most British movies that are based on television series, this film does kick off and it seems to be on to a winner, but the pace suddenly stops when the three mediocre characters are in the real world waiting to capture the three comedians.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film then doesn&#39;t go anywhere when Hillary in a room with the captured Steve, Lipp masquerading as Steve, and Geoff somehow writing himself in to the Medieval times. Which made me think &#39;hang on? How come he doesn&#39;t need a key to enter in to that world unlike the Royston Vasey characters? The medieval scene was okay but Monty Python did it a lot better and of course funnier, with cameos from Peter Kay and Simon Pegg, both didn&#39;t say anything funny, Kay had a line and Pegg just sat up on wall looking bored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What also grated me was that they seem to forget what happened in the previous episodes such as Hillary escaped to the Caribbean in the television in series 2, but in the film he&#39;s escaped from prison, and also Lipp is a paedophile vampire which wasn&#39;t mentioned at all in the movie, which was also quite disturbing when he&#39;s left alone looking after the children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were lots of plot holes and unexplained situations such as how did Geoff and the Dark One escape from the Medieval times back in to Royston Vasey? Like Series 3 it started of good but as the film progressed, it slowly went downhill and had a very weak predictable ending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They would of been better off doing what Monty Python did and remade all their best and classic sketches from Series 1-3 and the Christmas special, and turned that in to a film which would of re-introduced the characters to a whole new audience, who can&#39;t be asked to watch the series or to tight to buy the DVDs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best advice is save your money and wait till it&#39;s on television..... Where it belongs.&#34;
b&#39;This movie was one of a handful that actually caused me pain. It might be enjoyed by anybody who thinks that it would be funny to see his/her mother in a crowded discotheque full of people half her age &#34;inventing&#34; some totally ridiculous dance in a completely misguided effort to be &#34;hip&#34; (in the parlance of that age). To see Ingrid Bergman stoop to such a pitiful performance on the disco dance floor was hard to watch. I was embarrassed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make matters worse, the music in the disco was not realistic at all - it is the bogus idea of some Hollywood director about what pop music was like at the time. That is always a total embarrassment in most films of that era - the ersatz music is canned and bears only a painful, passing resemblance to the music that was actually popular in the 60\&#39;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mathau is hopelessly miscast as some kind of ladies\&#39; man; he just looks lecherously grotesque. Hawn\&#39;s wide-eyed innocence is just too silly. The handsome neighbor in her apartment is portrayed way too earnestly and seriously. He seems like a Brady kid who got lost in this farce. Painful, pitiful mess.&#39;
b&#39;The only reason I bought the DVD was to satisfy my curiosity about the scene when Liz (Kim Basinger) strips to the music of Joe Cocker: You Can Leave Your Hat On! That was the best part of the whole film. Not because the scene was any good; only the song. I am not saying it was a terribly bad film just not that good. Disappointingly so!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Especially when the exploration of male and female sexuality could have been expanded upon. Instead of expanding on the dangerous side of lust, obsession and infatuation and where it can lead to it drags its heels obscurely from one idea to the other. For example when John (played by Rourke) is able to leave her on the top of the Big Wheel, Liz (Kim Basinger) is unconvincingly rattled at the bizarre experience courtesy of John\&#39;s sense of humor but less rattled at his sexual exploits involving the ever willing Liz; and like one reader mentioned, that for a woman to enjoy sex she has to experience the dangerous side is unconvincing. This &#34;dangerous&#34; side is not exploited enough in the film and one gets a sense of anti-climax from the view point that it all could go horribly wrong. The theme of bondage makes an appearance often but only just takes one to the brink of danger and then all goes well.Is the film sending the message out that this kind of &#34;foreplay&#34; is FINE! If the film was making a point about the pitfalls of bondage and by extension the ugly ramifications of sad-masochism then maybe it would make a good moral point. Instead the film awkwardly jumps from one &#34;sizzling&#34; scene of Rourke feeding Basinger and blindfolding her to another. In a film that could have been good it falls flat on its face because it does not expand and extend the themes the film is MAYBE trying to relate; thus for me it doesn\&#39;t have a plot nor a theme just a mixture of ideas.&#39;
b&#39;&#34;Happy Days&#34; was produced and broadcast from the mid-1970\&#39;s to the early 1980\&#39;s and seems to get more ridiculous with age. At the time of its broadcast, most viewers who grew up in the 1950\&#39;s were in middle age with families, and the scenes at Mel\&#39;s Diner probably brought an artificial nostalgia to them. The Fonz was of course the coolest of the cool (although the actor Henry Wrinkler to this day has never learned how to ride a motorcycle). Richie Cunningham was the all-American blond-haired kid who would probably be elected student body president. Potsie was Richie\&#39;s best friend--the star of the show has to have a best friend, I guess. And Ralph Malph was the bumbling sidekick to the Fonz, if not the entire group. I loved it when the Fonz would beat up on poor Ralph Malph. And there was Mel, the middle-aged lug who ran Mel\&#39;s Diner. And of course who could forget the appearance of Mork? Was this really the 1950\&#39;s? Ironically, films produced during the 1950\&#39;s, such as &#34;Rebel Without a Cause&#34; and &#34;The Wild One&#34; have gotten better with age and portray the period more honestly than this show which was produced 20 years after the period it portrays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the TV show &#34;Happy Days&#34; is not in the same league as &#34;Rebel Without a Cause&#34; or &#34;American Graffitti&#34; for that matter. &#34;Happy Days&#34; may have captured some aspects of the 1950\&#39;s with its burger diner, juke boxes, cool cars, and tacky plaid shirts, but it is more a nostalgic idealism done strictly for laughs rather than an honest portrayal. &#34;American Graffitti&#34; had something to say about young Americans in the 1950\&#39;s whereas &#34;Happy Days&#34; seemed more about what middle-aged people of the 1970\&#39;s wished the 1950\&#39;s had been like. The result was a kind of watered down fabrication that really has nothing to do with the 1950\&#39;s. &#34;Happy Days&#34; is, at best, a comedy-fantasy with some of the artificial culture of the 1950\&#39;s as its backdrop. As pointed out by another reviewer, the all-American kid Richie Cunningham would probably have been chastised for befriending the likes of a drop-out like Fonzie. And Mel would probably forbid Fonzie from entering his Diner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A quick history: &#34;Happy Days&#34; was originally a pilot called &#34;Love in the Happy Days&#34; that was rejected for broadcast. Comedy pilots that had themes concerning sex and romance that did not make it to pilot airing sometimes appeared on the infrequently broadcast show &#34;Love American Style&#34; which was often aired in place of baseball games that had rained out or other unexpected programming cancellations and/or alterations. In short, &#34;Love American Style&#34; was a throw-away show that contained all these one-episode comedy pilots that never made it to a slotted debut. &#34;Love in the Happy Days&#34; did appear as a &#34;Love American Style&#34; show sometime in the early 1970\&#39;s, but at the time TV executives could not foresee how a show about 1950\&#39;s young people would be popular, particularly during the hey-day of comedy shows centering around middle-aged people, such as The &#34;Mary Tyler Moore Show&#34; (and its subsequent spin-offs such &#34;Rhoda&#34;), &#34;The Bob Newhart Show&#34;, and &#34;All in the Family&#34;. (How things have changed since now most TV sitcoms are about young people and the industry avoids most shows about middle-aged people like the plague!) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Subsequently, one of the young stars of &#34;Love in the Happy Days&#34;, a child actor from &#34;The Andy Griffith Show&#34; named Ron Howard, got the chance to star in a film about young people taking place in 1959 called &#34;American Graffitti&#34; directed by the relatively unknown George Lucas whose previous &#34;THX 1138&#34; had bombed miserably at the box office. Even when it was premiered to movie executives, again the studios could not see how a movie about young people in the 1950\&#39;s could become popular because it didn\&#39;t &#34;fit&#34; with what had been popular in the past, although they didn\&#39;t realize that much of the movie-going audience had been young in the 1950\&#39;s. As everyone knows, the movie was a huge hit, and studio executives recognized that they had completely misjudged their audience. Somewhere during the theatrical run of &#34;American Graffitti&#34;, TV executives realized they had a comedy pilot in their vault that was a lot like &#34;American Graffitti&#34;. They brought it back with the original cast, plus Henry Wrinkler as &#34;The Fonz&#34;, re-titled it &#34;Happy Days&#34; and the rest is TV history as it became one of the most popular shows of the 1970\&#39;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Happy Days&#34; now seems ridiculous. The characters are flat and cardboard, never being more or less than what they superficially are. The issues they deal with are trivial. And their reactions appear mindless and even silly. Nowadays, the character of the Fonz seems to be a caricature of, well, The Fonz. Was the idea to be a kind of parody of Marlon Brando\&#39;s character in &#34;The Wild One&#34;? Looking on the show with fresh eyes, I feel the producers really missed out on a great opportunity to present the 1950\&#39;s with depth and realism that still could be fun and entertaining. Instead the producers decided on cheap laughs for quick bucks. This is definitely a show that has not withstood the test of time. &#34;American Graffitti&#34; has many of the outward appearances of &#34;Happy Days&#34; but it had an edge. It had an honesty about the characters and their issues. &#34;Happy Days&#34; took the look of &#34;American Graffitti&#34; but failed to take its heart.&#39;
b&#34;Loving the Andersen fairy tails as a child and recently having seen some intriguing documentaries on this odd, though brilliant, author, I eagerly looked forward to see this made-for-TV film. Unfortunately the experience was nothing but a disappointment leaving me in anger and confusion. First of all the story/script is filled with inaccuracies and downright fantasies and in this way creating almost a completely new story while shamefully abusing Andersen&#39;s fairy tales, presumably in order to sell the crap to suckers like me. Secondly, pretty-boy actor (really... ever seen a picture of the real Andersen?) Kieran Brew manages to portray Hans Christian as mentally retarded rather than the brilliant though very disturbed character he indeed was. Though annoying and irritating like Andersen, Brew is missing the required charisma to create any feelings of compassion what so ever. Thirdly. The love story between Andersen and the fictional Jetta (whom actually should be Henriette, the wife of Edvard Collin)... Why? This man has lived such an interesting life, it should be enough as a foundation to a great movie!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could continue this to be a very long list but feel it safest to simply recommend all of you to spend your time and money on something else instead.&#34;
b&#34;This is a crummy film, a pretender to a genre of surprise ending movies. And a genre that has been done so much better before. The plot limps along, with a predictable ending. (Yawn) The characters are unlikeable, and some are so unlikeable they are almost unwatchable. Matt Dillon, a fine, intense actor is totally miscast here and is stiff and mannered. The others are forgettable. Much of the dialog is sophomoric, again a pretender trying to be witty. I wouldn&#39;t hire the screenwriter to write my grocery list. Yes, it&#39;s that bad, veering from misogynistic to just plain gross, as in beyond frat-house gross. With so much real talent out there, I&#39;m really surprised this movie ever got made. It shows the total lack of imagination of the office suits...&#34;
b&#34;I have always liked Bill Murray in films like Lost in Translation, and the trailer for this film looked really good, but the result was very disappointing. Basically Murray plays Jack Corcorin who has recently found out that his father died, and he is expected to hear his will. He finds out that his father was a clown, because he left a large shoe, his squeaky nose, and his main inheritance, an elephant! The only way that Jack can get rid of this elephant is to travel 4000 miles in four days and give him to a safe zoo for $30,000. Also starring Pat Hingle as Vernon. There are small tiny moments of humour, such as a truck&#39;s front bending forward, and Murray screaming, but overall, it&#39;s pointless. Pretty poor!&#34;
b&#39;I had heard that this film was stylish and intriguing, but I just found it annoying. It\&#39;s been a while since I\&#39;ve seen it (and hopefully I won\&#39;t find out all my memories are wrong and I\&#39;m unjustly condemning this movie), but my memory is that the filmmakers tried to portray Leopold and Loeb as victimized by an anti-gay society, and that this somehow caused their horrible crime. I totally disagree with this point of view, and think it\&#39;s unfair both to homosexuals and to Bobby Franks, the real victim of the story. I can\&#39;t imagine why anyone would want to claim those two as martyrs. I also thought L&amp;L were portrayed as a bit more sophisticated than they actually were--after all, they were teenagers who lived at home. The film places them in a kind of fantasy world that seems like it should be scored by Morrissey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just read an interview with one of the filmmakers that implied the film\&#39;s anachronisms, such as the push-button phones that characters used, were meant &#34;to add Brechtian distance&#34;. They certainly do that, but I happened to find it highly irksome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently a number of people found this movie interesting, but I would have preferred a less &#34;stylish&#34; and more realistic examination of the part homosexuality may have played in the Leopold &amp; Loeb case.&#39;
b&#39;As a Scot I find the idea of &#34;Macbeth&#34; shifted in Time and Space to America totally moronic.I am sure this doesn\&#39;t apply to broadminded IMDb Users,but why are so many Americans unable to relate to ANY film concept that isn\&#39;t set in their Country ? This attitude does Americans no favours in the Big Wide World out here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was bad enough that &#34;The Wicker Man&#34; was remade and set in the USA ,totaly stripped of its Cultural context, and with a Polticaly Correct gender change for a leading Character.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One wonders what next,Robert The Bruce as a New York cop ?,Mary Queen of Scots as a &#34;Soccer Mom&#34; juggling ,kids ,a career and relationships ?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come on Hollywood, open up to all the other Cultures on the Planet!&#39;
b&#39;I rated this one better than awful because I liked seeing Jonathon from Buffy in something again -- even if it was the same role.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the concept is kind of cute for a short, but not an entire movie. The writing was forced and contrived. I have the feeling that the movie suffered the most during editing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, Amanda Bynes always looks like her eyes are crossed -- even when she\&#39;s not trying to do it. She\&#39;s just not funny. She always plays some sort of misfit girl who triumphs by being herself -- ironic, considering Amanda seems to always be a caricature. I would actually like to see her in something serious. I really want to give her a chance, but she is always cast in these trite roles where she wiggles and makes faces and somehow that\&#39;s a good thing?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the whole &#34;I\&#39;m a Dork&#34; segment was ripped off from Revenge of the Nerds. There was nothing in this movie that was unpredictable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shame, shame, shame.&#39;
b&#34;There are spoilers but trust me, I&#39;m doing you a favor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friends and I like to watch crappy movies every so often. Inspired by Mystery Science Theater and our knack for on the spot jokes; We set out to find movies worth watching that are in fact...not worth watching. However trouble comes into paradise when these movies can only be found if you buy them. And I am a firm believer in not giving one cent to such a group of talentless scumbags. So, as another reviewer has said, films like this are a reason why downloading movies for free should be legalized. I prefer the idea of; instead of straight to VIDEO you have straight to INTERNET. That way the ass-bags who made this travesty won&#39;t ever turn a profit. Which unfortunately you know they do. They hire a bunch of actors who can&#39;t act, special effects from a high school classroom, rubber snakes you can get at the dollar store, constant vomiting of green jell-o, and the two main characters who seem to switch between being border jumping Mexicans who only speak Spanish, to Arabs to being 100% fluent in English, random nudity, a guy being shot like 10 times including one to the side of the head and living and the most retarded ending in the history of film, book, cave drawings and hustler magazine. The fact that I actually predicted that the jell-o puking snake girl would actually TRANSFORM into a snake about half way through terrifies me...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, the movie is great to make fun of, but you have to make sure there&#39;s at least 4 of you and you&#39;re all spitting out jokes in rapid fire, because if there&#39;s even 1 second of watching this movie where you&#39;re not laughing your ass off, you will feel physically ill. I kid you not. My friends and I were eating chicken wings and now I can&#39;t even look at such a thing anymore without being reminded of this piece of Sh!t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film is one above Alien Vs. Hunter which is by far the second worst movie ever made. And I&#39;ve seen lots of bad movies. Incidentally, it&#39;s the same production company as this film and that bald guy is in both as well. just thought you might like to know that little fun fact. -100 out 0f 10.&#34;
b&#34;As a sci-fi and casual Angelina Jolie fan, I thought this obviously low-budget movie might be worth a look... maybe it had a few scenes or a storyline that would make up for all its other faults. Plus, it might be interesting to watch Angelina as she was embarking on her star-bound career.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh how wrong I was. One thing I learned -- at 18, Angelina Jolie couldn&#39;t act. So, to make her comfortable, the producers cast this entire movie with people who couldn&#39;t act. Seeing this, Jack Palance (who can actually act) decided to overact. Watching 10 minutes of this happen is enough to burn your eyes out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the horrible acting and overacting add a nonsensical script, insipid dialog, bottom-of-the-barrel cinematography... in fact add bottom-of-the-barrel everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story features Angelina as a cyborg programmed by her corporate overlords as an assassin. She escapes the corporate HQ with the help of her combat instructor. The corporation sends bounty hunters after them. Stupid stuff happens. The end. I would tell you more but I didn&#39;t want to waste my life watching this dreck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I implore you -- this is not worth watching. Its not even worth thinking about watching. Save yourself the pain and move on.&#34;
b&#34;A group of tourists are stranded on Snake Island after an unfortunate accident with their boat. They are forced to spend the night and as you probably suspected, it isn&#39;t called Snake Island because it&#39;s just soooooo much fun to say - it has a history of people disappearing one by one because of the large snake population, which is just what happens with these poor dumb souls. This is a very boring and typical movie with tons of off screen snake attacks and lousy performances from NOBODY actors. The only somewhat entertaining scene was an absolutely unnecessary and forced strip scene which ain&#39;t anything couldn&#39;t see in a PG13 rated movie, folks. If you are into snake movies than check out SSSSSSS, but don&#39;t torture yourself with this crap.&#34;
b&#39;Yahoo Serious is like a $3 bottle of wine - had no substance to begin with and just gets worse with age. This film proves he is completely toxic. We can only hope that this is his final film and that its serious lack of success will diminish his chances of obtaining finance for any future ventures. It is right up there with &#34;Lightning Jack&#34; and &#34;Les Patterson Saves the World&#34; as the most abysmal example of Australian comedy imaginable. How tragic it is that with so many infinitely superior comedic talents in Australia Yahoo is given such vehicles to express his brand of puerile school yard comedy. And to think - he had 7 years to come up with the script. True genius!&#39;
b&#39;This show drives me crazy. It goes against everything a family should be, even if it is intended to be a comedy. The show is suppose to follow Dave and Vicky Gold (Michael Rapaport and Anita Barone) as they raise their three teenage children: Hilary, Larry, and Mike. A good premises for a comedy yes but it does not mean it will be a good show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don\&#39;t think I\&#39;ve ever heard cruder talk from parents to children and vice versa. The only talk that seems to be in the show is control of children by the parents and sex. I know that sexual intercourse is usually a subject talked about by teenagers often but it is brought up in nearly every episode with no point to it. The one episode I was just watching involved the parents giving their daughter, Hilary a car, not once do you think they are related in anyway by the way they talk to each other and how the parents talk about how Hilary is like &#34;their slave.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The show fails on the comedy level the most. I haven\&#39;t laughed at this show once in the numerous times I have attempted to watch it, and I\&#39;m a person who gave such films as Animal House and Dumb and Dumber very high marks. Michael Rapaport is a very good actor and why he choose to ruin his career by making this piece of filth show is beyond me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parents, make sure your children never and I mean never watch this. Teenagers, you\&#39;ll probably get a laugh out of this just for the blatant sexual references but nothing comes out of it and afterwards you feel rather empty. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 1/2/ 5 Stars.&#39;
b&#39;When I started watching this, I instantly noticed that I couldn\&#39;t understand what anyone was saying. I turned up the volume. With background noises now booming out, I could hear the voices. Just what are the actors saying? Is the movie not dubbed? Are they speaking Spanish? After some confusion, I realize that it was English. At least, I think so... The Amazing Jess Franco has placed the microphones too far away from the actors. As a result, we cannot completely hear what they are saying. He\&#39;s done this before. But maybe this is Mr. Franco\&#39;s intention? By not knowing what people are saying, we are thrown into some mystery about what is going on, and are left with more visual clues... Maybe it\&#39;s just me, but I would have liked to know what was going on! How about a few hints? The basic premise (I refuse to call it a &#34;plot&#34;) concerns a young American exotic dancer named Paula (played by Amber Newman) who has a boyfriend who gets her invited to a small island owned by some sleazy rich people. It is somewhere off the coast of Spain. For this visit, a large cash payment is promised to Paula, which the boyfriend gets. He then escapes from the island, only to return later. Why? Pay close attention to the scene where the boyfriend opens Paula\&#39;s US passport. Though his hand tried to cover it up, you can see the actress\&#39; REAL name, Amber Newman, printed below the photo on the bottom of the passport!! Anyway, back to the &#34;story&#34;: There are some other sleazy, rich, beautiful characters visiting the island, all with ambiguous motives. We witness sadistic games (are they real or fake?) and unappealing dining scenes. But the food must be good, as a phony French chef prepared it! There is a young woman servant who runs around naked and never speaks. Is she really mute? And do we care? Of course all the women are mostly naked throughout this film... Oh well, we can at least be thankful that the (50+ and overweight) men remain clothed! In addition to the abysmal sound quality, what I have always marveled at about Jess Franco is his amazing ability to film beautiful naked women in such a way that leaves the viewer completely turned off. This film is no exception \xc2\x96 I needed fresh air after watching it! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion: I am happy to report that regardless of what Mr. Franco can dream up, I am still attracted to women.&#39;
b&#34;I&#39;ve watched the first 15 minutes and I can tell that there was no consultation with any military type personnel. Judith Light&#39;s charactor (an officer) has her hair down past her shoulders! One of the first officers that greets her as she walks in to the medical facility she works at is so overweight that his pant pockets gap! No - there was no military advising them on this movie. Even an ex-military enlisted could have assisted here.&#34;
b&#39;The name of Bad Company\&#39;s greatest hits album is called &#34;10 From 6&#34;. You could have just turned up this album and cut the sound on this movie. Most of the songs played in the movie were from this album. I guess oldsters during the 1970s were probably tired of all the period pieces made then about the 1930s and 1940s. That\&#39;s how I feel about movies made about the 1970s. The characters in the movie looked like they were auditioning for Danny Terrio. Why is it that movies have to exaggerate the 1970s. The only good period piece I liked was &#34;Freaks and Geeks&#34;. They cut that television show. It was exactly like things were in high school when I was there back circa 1980. I was old enough to remember the 70s and no small town was like this. It was totally youth dominated. There were no reactionaries talking about the hippies and about the inner city of Philly. That was more the 70s that I remember as a kid. This movie was very dull and cheesy. At times, I was falling asleep. I don\&#39;t know why an actor who was acting during the 70s, appeared in this one. He was probably trying to lend it some credibility. Walken didn\&#39;t even show up until the second half. I guess the only true thing about the movie was the &#34;baby boomers&#34; were/are a spoiled lot. All the kids in the movie were spoiled brats. I don\&#39;t know what they had against their father.&#39;
b&#39;Harrison Ford playing a playing a cop in a crime thriller. The perfect ingredients it SEEMS for top entertainment with Harrison back to his Indy and Han Solo best, protecting a witness from ruthless and merciless murderers. How easy it is to be fooled. If the film concentrated on the main, supposed, themes of crime and suspense instead of putting up barns and shoving ice creams in peoples faces it possibly could have been more worthwhile. Unbelieveably predictable with the best method of despatching of a foe is with corn.&#39;
b&#34;I don&#39;t normally write reviews, but for this film I had to. I&#39;m shocked at the acting talent in this move going to waste... the script was appalling... the editing awful... and the plot very thin. You spend the first half of the movie wondering who is talking to who and what on earth they are doing. The latter half of the movie slows down slightly, but has no depth or feeling. The only saving grace is the nice, but still limited cgi, and the location being London. I gave 3 stars for that, and the fact the actors still tried to do a good job with the drivel they were given. If you fancy losing a couple of hours of your life with mediocre popcorn disaster movie entertainment, by all means, this is the movie for you. But I would recommend doing something else with your time instead, like watching the real archive footage online! :) http://www.weatherpaparazzi.com/flooding.asp&#34;
b&#39;This is possibly the worst thing I\&#39;ve ever seen on television. First, I\&#39;m pretty sure it takes itself entirely seriously, and I tend to be pretty good at recognizing satire. Second, it displays Aristotelian levels of chauvinism; in one of the ads for it, one of the &#34;playas&#34; describes women in terms of &#34;quality&#34;. Third, every contestant I\&#39;ve seen on it (six, I think) was a dim-witted meathead of the variety likely to possess a Facebook with &#34;BONING U&#34; or &#34;WOMEN&#34; entered under &#34;Here For&#34;. To paraphrase Roger Ebert, this doesn\&#39;t scrape the bottom of the barrel, nor deserve mention in the same sentence as barrels. The closest thing to a redeeming feature I\&#39;ve experienced with regards to Key to the VIP was having a female friend reassure me that the male cast were indeed the opposite of attractive, in both physical and mental terms.&#39;
b&#39;Jeff Fahey has such alert eyes and a smudgy, insidious smile that every character he plays seems villainous; therefore, it doesn\&#39;t really work to cast him as the good guy of the piece, the audience is just waiting for his character to crack and start blowing people away. Drew Barrymore, fresh off her acclaimed role as &#34;Poison Ivy&#34;, must have done this film simply as a favor to director Phedon Papamichael (he was the cinematographer on &#34;Ivy&#34;); playing a character named Daisy Drew (!), she\&#39;s bumped off right away, which leaves us with no one to look at but Jeff Fahey and Sean Young (who hasn\&#39;t had a single subtle moment on camera since &#34;Blade Runner&#34;). This witless script, by Michael Angeli, concerns a police sketch artist who draws his own wife\&#39;s face from a murder witness\&#39;s testimony, and while that\&#39;s not a bad idea for a plot, it would be much better suited to an hour-long TV series. This cable-made movie is short on inspiration (beginning with the casting) and shorter on surprises. * from ****&#39;
b&#34;I wouldn&#39;t call myself a big fan of the genre inventive silliness, so i might not be the best audience for this show. Although, being a critic i do have a sense for what i personally like and dislike, this being the later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lack of humor is a big turnoff when it comes to comedy, things can be catchy, cool and perky for about 4 minutes and after that you start getting bored unless its the badger animation from a couple of years ago (?) This is the exact opposite, with a stiff script and all overacted voice-overs its just plain silly and very very boring to be subjected to. Unfortunately, since it did have a big market ahead of itself, and a lot of potential.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A waste of time.&#34;
b&#34;Well to do American divorc\xc3\xa9e with more money than brains buys a rundown villa in Tuscany. (Much more money; whilst having to dicker over the price, she subsequently manages to cook sumptuous buffets for her workmen and wander around Italy indefinitely with no job or apparent means of support.) Interminable boredom and the inevitable Italian lover ensue; this is a chick flick in the most pejorative sense of the term. Lane acts like an unskilled clueless teenage ing\xc3\xa9nue throughout - which dynamically clashes with her seriously fading looks - along the way smashing into a variety of (mostly Italian) cardboard stereotypes, dykes, divas, senile contessas and gigolos among them. Bloated with unnecessary scenes, the most ridiculous being a clumsily inserted and pointless recreation of the fountain scene in &#39;La Dolce Vita&#39;. (A similar conceit was used in an effective and appropriate narrative context in &#39;Only You&#39;, Norman Jewison&#39;s vastly superior ode to Italy and romance). &#39;Tuscan Sun&#39; may be the most vacant piece of cinema of the last decade, despite its admittedly well-lensed panoramas of Italy. Bonus negative point for the extraneous lover parachuted in at the last minute to provide requisite Hollywood ending for its targeted audience of Oprah-brainwashed housewives. Avoid at all costs, unless, of course, you view Oprah and Dr. Phil as pinnacles of intelligent discourse.&#34;
b&#34;I attended a screening of &#39;The Cooler&#39; at the Toronto Film Festival this year. While the other reviews I&#39;ve read seem to be generally (and mystifyingly) positive, I must tell you without any kind of axe to grind that this film is unimaginably, unspeakably bad. The very brave and candid performances by William H. Macy and Maria Bello have been horribly misspent on what is probably the least polished, most clich\xc3\xa9d script to have received the green light in years. I don&#39;t know how bad The Brown Bunny was, but I&#39;m certain it couldn&#39;t have attained the Dante-style depths that this one did. As courageous as their performances were, perhaps the bravest thing these otherwise brilliant actors did was to entrust themselves to such a dreadful director and abysmal screenplay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He must pitch pretty well in the boardroom, because he should never been permitted to be within a hundred yards of a camera. The dialogue is so embarrassingly contrived and clumsy that I actually found myself blushing during the screening. I am mortified that the talents of Macy have been totally squandered in the hands of someone whose direction is as incompetent as his writing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watching gifted actors like Alec Baldwin labor through Kramer&#39;s appalling script and ham-fisted direction was akin to watching a baby seal get clubbed to death - I felt angered, helpless, and sickened all at the same time. Although I am always glad that there are investors and industry-people willing to take risks on quirky scripts with interesting premises, this picture was a total, utter fiasco. Kramer couldn&#39;t have been crueler to these actors if he had himself taken a steel pipe to their knees. I hope for their sakes they can all avoid similar humiliations in the future. Macy wisely ducked out the side door and didn&#39;t even stick around for the screening. Regrettably, it seems that the bad luck of main character has rubbed off on the picture in the worst possible way. Anyone accustomed to quality independents will likely find it completely unbearable.&#34;
b&#39;But I still enjoyed watching her, so I gave it a 3 instead of a 1. Her expressions are priceless. Some of the other cast members (e.g., Michael McKean) are really slumming, too. The cat himself is somewhat amusing. Aside from that, the movie is all cliche, culminating in a much-too-long car chase. (It\&#39;s also at this point that the movie becomes unnecessarily crude, having been very &#34;family&#34; until then.)&#39;
b&#39;I truly despair for womankind when they discuss this joke of a programme as if it\&#39;s intellectually engaging and promotes female liberation and independence. This show is the biggest insult to women next to all those libidinous hip-hop videos. If talking like a bunch of reckless teenage boys over $100 lunches in swanky restaurants, indiscriminately shopping for unnecessary fashion and jumping into bed with the nearest male in site is considered empowering, the fate of western women may be doomed as we speak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the damage it does to the female gender, Sex and the City is NOT ENTERTAINING. Not once has it been funny, captivating, exciting or original. The episodes play out monotonously. Each character are factory produced mannequins who behave in the same manner every episode. Not once have any of these shallow, unattractive women evolved. Perhaps the worst is lead character Carrie Bradshaw. Aside from looking hideous, her penchant for over analysis of relationships is cringe worthy. On top of all this, the show portrays men as a bunch of empty headed slobs who are unable to commit to healthy relationships. Even when there is a decent man, he is somehow painted as a villain. The utter lack of empathy for men is clearly the work of some &#34;progressive&#34; pseudo feminist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saddest part of the whole show is that these women live unfortunate miserable lives. Any intelligent woman would never envy them. It is a banal show with even more banal characters. The NYC tourist board must hate the way this garbage is showing up their otherwise fine city! Thankfully this train wreck is over! Desperate Housewives is seen as the fitting replacement for SATC. While DH can be quite far-fetched, at least it explores women in more multi-faceted ways. Plus it treats men more respectfully and it\&#39;s actually entertaining!&#39;
b&#34;I am not quite sure I agree with the director of this version of The Scarlet Pimpernel. I imagined Sir Percy Blakeney a very calm, seemingly lazy aristocrat. This particular Sir Percy Blakeney appears to be teeming with overwhelming energy and volatility. I did not appreciate the Houdini, James Bond, Mission Impossible style escapes that Sir Percy engineered either. In the previous versions, wit was the tool for escape, not technology. Neither were the characters of Marguerite and Chauvelin adequately portrayed. There seemed to be little energy or chemistry in the interaction between the characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not wish to assign any blame, for perhaps the reason for my dislike of this movie might simply be a matter of difference in interpretation. Had the director&#39;s interpretation coincided with mine, perhaps I might not have been irritated by what seemed to me bad character portrayals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I much preferred the version from 1982. Anthony Andrews was quite efficient as the imperturbable, calm fop. So were Jane Seymour and Ian McKellen. In my opinion, the style of this period piece seems to have been lost with this latest adaption. I recommend sticking with the previous versions, either the one from 1934 or the one from 1982.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;
b&#39;Sigh. I\&#39;m baffled when I see a short like this get attention and assignments and whatnot. I saw this film at a festival before the filmmaker got any attention and forgot about it immediately afterwards. It was mildly annoying to see it swiping the Grinch Who Stole Christmas heart gag along with the narration, the set design seen many times before, the whole weak Tim Burton-ish style, and the story that goes nowhere. And we got the &#34;joke&#34; about shooting the crows with the 45 the first time, alright?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I guess what\&#39;s really unacceptable is that it even swipes its basic concept from a comic book circa 1999 called LENORE, THE CUTE LITTLE DEAD GIRL by Roman Dirge! As any quick internet search will reveal. I mean, what is this? This is what they base a Hollywood contract on and opens doors in Canada for a filmmaker? &#34;Give your head a shake&#34; as Don Cherry might say.&#39;
b&#39;I remember all the hype around this movie when Aaliyah was killed. Being a fan of Ms. Rice\&#39;s novels, my first thought was &#34;how can they do Queen Of The Damned without doing Vampire Lestat first?&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having finally seen the movie, now I can see how they did it. If you have read these books, imagine taking out the gory parts from Vampire Lestat, cramming Marcus and Marius into one character, and removing everything to do with Lestat\&#39;s beginning (the wolf hunt, his violin playing, the Theatre Of The Vampires, and also Louis, Claudia, and Gabrielle), then in the last 15 minutes cramming in Queen Of The Damned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What we loose is a very important piece of Lestat\&#39;s character. His inner agony of having to kill to live, the fact that he carefully tries to select killers as his victims, and his love-hate relationship with Louis, Armand, Gabrielle, and all the other vampires.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also important to the story is that we loose the &#34;Story Of The Twins&#34;, which is the Genesis of Ms. Rice\&#39;s vampires. And while I am sure the cannibalism was to intense for showing on the screen, they could have done something closer, and showed us more of ancient Egypt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even worse, we have this love interest thrown in between Jessie and Lestat. The Vampire Chronicles is basically an American Yoni story. For those that do not know, Yoni is another form of Hentai (Japanese Porn Comics). But in Yoni, it is about gay male relationships, told by a female. While I am sure many men object to the &#34;gayness&#34; of the characters, in this movie they went to the far extreme the opposite way. For instead of Lestat persueing killers, he goes after young female groupies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the other flaws in logic and storyline are vast. At the beginning Lestat emerges from a century long sleep, then later on asks Marius how he made it through the 1950\&#39;s in red velvet. Marius has no idea who Elvis is, and says he slept through that period. Makes you wonder how Lestat knows about 50\&#39;s fashion and music, since he slept through the same time period himself. And nothing is ever even mentioned about Louis, Claudia, or Gabrielle. I think that is a huge shame. Is like seeing &#34;Snow White and the 3 Dwarfs&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the movie I thought was really bad. About the only good thing about it was the soundtrack. Most of the acting was poor, the accents drove me up the wall, and all of the really in-depth parts of the book were removed, leaving us only with a hollow shell, kind of like Enkil after he was sucked dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to see a good modern vampire movie, get Lost Boys, the original Interview With A Vampire, or even some old episodes of Dark Shadows. Let this one Rest In Piece, with a stake through the heart, cloves of garlic around the neck, and a vial of Holy Water in the mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In ending, remember that before Aaliyah was killed, this was intended to go straight to video, no theatrical release was planned. It is obvious now why this was. It is only sad that somebody as talented as she will be remembered for this dog of a movie, instead of something where she really might have shined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rate this a 2 on a scale of 1-10.&#39;
b&#34;Lately, I&#39;ve been watching a lot of westerns from the 1930s to the present. There are some great low budget spaghetti westerns from the late 1960s and early 1970s. This movie had all the elements of a decent western: a good story with talented actors and everything else. Although, it&#39;s a spoof of this genre, and for me the way it was done just didn&#39;t work and made for a disappointing movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie can easily be divided into two parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first part is great; it has a great opening scene and an interesting story develops of a bounty hunter (a.k.a. the stranger) going after a bandit who is going after a large bank shipment guarded, in part, by a banker. Over the course of the movie these three characters form shifting alliances in an attempt to get the money. There are subtle comic nods to the contrivances of earlier films from this genre, but the comedy doesn&#39;t disrupt the overall story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second half of the film is where the comedy goes over-the-top and essentially ruins the movie. The turning point is right at the part where the barmaid causally scolds the dwarf to stop shooting the customers as she goes about waiting on other patrons seemingly oblivious to the four dead bodies laying about the place. From this point onward the movie shifts from a decent spaghetti western with comic undertones to a stupid-silly spoof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are three horrible fist-fight scenes (one at the river, one in the market and one at the baths) that follow in rapid succession as if one wasn&#39;t bad enough. The fighting is so fake it&#39;s ridiculous, and since the sound is out-of-sync with the picture it makes it even worse. In the market fight scene the banker bounces about the place on hidden trampolines and twirls around on poles like he is in the circus; it&#39;s clownish. Although, the worst part of these fight scenes is the music; it&#39;s this light-hearted, sprightly mix more suited for a square dance or a cheesy episode of &#39;Hee-Haw&#39;. These scenes practically derail the main story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this movie was disappointing because it had a lot of potential as a decent western, but the comic turns just mucked it up. If you want to see a good western spoof then see &#39;Blazing Saddles&#39;. If you want to see a good spaghetti western, then avoid this movie.&#34;
b&#39;A good friend of mine one said: &#34;A monkey is funny, anytime, anywhere.&#34; There is one exception to this: GOING BANANAS. It is quite simply the WORST MOVIE I have ever seen. It\&#39;s worse than PLAN 9, worse than THE BEAST OF YUCCA FLATS. It is TERRIBLE. The talking monkey gag gets old after about three minutes, and believe me that\&#39;s all there is. Make sure you have a bunch of people around to revive you after you go into TOXIC SHOCK from GOING BANANAS, the worst movie ever.&#39;
b&#39;What is about mathematical geniuses that get the critics juices flowing ? A BEAUTIFUL MIND wasn`t up to much in my opinion ( FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING deserved the Oscar that year ) while GOOD WILL HUNTING had several awards lavished on it undeservedly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off is the script . When I attended film school I was told GOOD WILL HUNTING is a very good example on how not to start a script and the tutor was right . This movie lacks any type of opening hook and for the most part it`s very very slow . If you wrote an unsolicited script like this the script reader would have given up on it by page 15&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Structure aside the idea of a member of the American underclass being some sort of intellectual god doesn`t really ring true . Ask yourself this : If he`s the cleverst character in the movie how come he`s gone through his short life without anyone noticing his abilities ? Not one single teacher from his childhood noticed his gift ? Highly unlikely as is the fact he`s read so much mind expanding litrature . And if Will`s so clever how come he`s so oblivous of what happens to young good looking boys in American prisons ?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it`s the casting that let much of the film down . You want to get a couple of actors to play rough tough Irish gang members ? Let`s get Matt Damon and Ben Affleck which is like getting Russell Crowe to play a pacifist or Charles Bronson to play a liberal do gooder . I failed to be convinced by the foul mouthed Damon and Affleck as they strutted about smacking people in the chops and couldn`t help thinking that even though they wrote the script the parts should have been awarded to different actors , after all Billy Bob Thornton has written screenplays for films he hasn`t been cast in and the same criteria should have been applied here&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some good points to the movie . Robin Williams is excellent as the man who tries to show Will his potential and also very good is Stellan Skarsgard who is quite simply one of the greatest character actors to stepped foot outside of Europe and despite my previous criticism of the script there is quite a moving piece of dialogue at the park as Williams character explains to Will what he has seen in life&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I`ve got to repeat that there`s less plus points than negatives to this movie and I`ve got to agree with the people who`ve said GOOD WILL HUNTING is boring and unconvincing&#39;
b&#39;From all the rave reviews, we couldn\&#39;t wait to see this show. We love wacky humor and creative material, especially from Australia and New Zealand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I admit this may not be a fair review since we only saw the first 15 minutes. But we just couldn\&#39;t bear any more misery - it was definitely the most boring and painful 15 minutes we\&#39;ve ever experienced watching a TV show - it felt like 15 hours. The songs may be (mildly) interesting by themselves, but inserted for an interminable 3 minutes each in the middle of a story scene just doesn\&#39;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We\&#39;re trying hard now to erase the memory. If you want some wonderful down-under humor in a delightful and engaging film, see &#34;The Dish&#34; instead.&#39;
b&#39;The most generic, surface-level biography you could hope for. Busey\&#39;s impersonation of Holly is accurate -- but who wants to hear Gary Busey sing &#34;Maybe Baby&#34;? Typically, the members of the Hollies are used for comic relief and melodrama (Smith and Stroud, respectively) instead of as people or even characters. When Holly uses a string section, the old jewish-looking guys who come in tell him he\&#39;s using the same techniques as Mozart. It\&#39;s just this kind of cheeky statement that makes film biographies like this (and &#34;Amadeus&#34;, about the aforementioned Mozart) so worthless. Some entertainment can be derived from Holly\&#39;s excellent styles and songs done in a B-variation.&#39;
b&#39;This is by far the most vapid, idiotic, insanely stupid show that has EVER been on the air, and this is coming from someone who remembers &#34;San Pedro Beach Bums&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife loves watching reality shows--and there was one episode of this drivel where the wannabes had to develop a &#34;walk&#34;. The end result was straight out of Monty Python\&#39;s &#34;Ministry of Silly Walks&#34; sketch. I couldn\&#39;t laugh hard enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then there\&#39;s the ubiquitous Ms. Banks (as in laughing all the way to the...). She has to be the most annoying self-important woman on TV since Rosie O\&#39;Donnell left &#34;The View&#34;. As if modeling was doing great things for mankind. Please. I\&#39;ve never found her attractive, and I don\&#39;t find her intelligent now that she has the temerity to open her mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone needs to tell these human clothes hangers to eat a healthy diet and actually look like real women.&#39;
b&#34;I cant go for long describing this tittle, simply because I do not feel strong about it. I read a few comments and I see that only proud and patriotic Frenchmen seem to like it, that&#39;s all I can say...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boring Long Sometimes even stupid...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. 7.4 out of 10, the viewers must be going crazy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cant go for long describing this tittle, simply because I do not feel strong about it. I read a few comments and I see that only proud and patriotic Frenchmen seem to like it, that&#39;s all I can say...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boring Long Sometimes even stupid...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. 7.4 out of 10, the viewers must be going crazy&#34;
b&#39;Ouch!! What a mess we have here. Not so much of a mess as a painfully dull, half-assed excuse for exploitation. Brought to you by the one and only, J. G. &#34;Pat&#34; Patterson, yeah, the same one from Moonshine Mountain. Doctor Gore, formerly known as The Body Shop, is, I guess, somewhat inspired by Frankenstein, and God knows what else. The Late Mr. Patterson also stars in this joke, as a heartbroken scientist/plastic surgeon, who has recently lost his wife in a car accident, and is driven insane from grief, to the point that it becomes clear that the next step is to slaughter countless females, then maybe rob a few graves for body parts, in order to &#34;put together&#34; the perfect mate. It won\&#39;t be easy, but thank goodness his pal Gregg the hunchback is available to lend a hand, and to offer moral support.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If proof was ever needed that some peoples goals are not meant to be accomplished, here it is, gang. This Patterson hayseed obviously never had any business directing anything, much less, following in the footsteps of good ol\&#39; H. G. as a master of gore. I\&#39;ve never seen a gore movie that just flat-out refuses to give the viewer a single reason to keep watching. Even the gore is boring. Almost remotely humorous at times, but impossible to tell whether it\&#39;s intentional or not. I pick &#34;not&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shot in Charolotte, North Carolina (home of the California Axe Massacre), on, most likely, a 3-digit budget, by a guy, as untalented as he may have been, who probably had an appreciation for drive-in trash, so, maybe we should give good ol\&#39; J. G. a break, I mean, he tried (I assume) which is more that can be said for most, and this movie is better than any of the big-budget super-hero garbage the theaters put out these days, although, I realize that isn\&#39;t saying much. Besides, Doctor Gore is quite the improvement over Patterson\&#39;s previous failure, The Electic Chair, so it\&#39;s slightly possible he would have improved his craft in time, had he not died, so maybe it\&#39;s not all that terrible, especially compared to the other movie on the DVD, How To Make A Doll, so what the hell, check it out. 4/10&#39;
b&#39;This is a perfect example of the 90\&#39;s mainstream horror crap.Nothing is scary here and the film is almost bloodless.Yes,there is some violence,but everything is politically correct like in a TV movie.This is not a completely bad picture,I can safely say that I found it quite enjoyable.However a lack of the originality really hurts &#34;Voodoo&#34;.All in all if you are a part of the mainstream audience and pseudo-horror movies like &#34;Scream&#34; are your favourite then you\&#39;ll love &#34;Voodoo&#34;,but if you want something very gruesome avoid this film.&#39;
b&#39;Director/lead Larry Bishop tried way, way too hard with Hell Ride. The movie wants to be edgy, witty, provocative, outlandish, biting all of this, seemingly in a Quentin Tarantino/Rob Zombie style. But it\&#39;s not edgy. The references seem forced. The dialog tries to be clever and fails. The humor is never funny. Nice try setting a gritty tone but we\&#39;d have to care about the characters or the story for it to remotely succeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What you\&#39;re left with are cool Harleys and pretty girls surrounding a bunch of tired, old and out of shape &#34;bad boys&#34; in what looks like an attempt to do a modernized Sergio Leone western. If this movie can make newer generations interested in 60s and 70s films, kudos for it. But on its own, it is rather boring and irrelevant. I do believe there is a place for style over substance. But this movie is not it.&#39;
b&#39;&#34;SHUT THE FRONT DOOR&#34; That\&#39;s what I said when I was told that Blockbuster got a new movie in called Snakes on a Train. Okay, maybe that\&#39;s not exactly what I said, but you get the point. I didn\&#39;t need to know who was in the movie, or anything else. All I knew was that I am renting this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I probably should have asked what it was about though. In retrospect, I don\&#39;t know if I would have really wanted to watch a movie about a Mayan curse that causes a woman to give internal birth to snakes and have them spit out of her mouth. Nor would I want to see a movie that features a guy who looks strangely enough like a pedophilic version of Leif Garrett.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, while the curse might be interesting on some levels (well, maybe not), there was still promise of these annoying characters getting eaten or at the very least, killed by snakes. So I was willing to sit through the first hour of very little happening other than a Texas Ranger forcing a girl into a nice little titty grope so she can keep her cocaine, or the Hispanic shaman that likes to occasionally stab people. But then, all hell broke loose, and the girl started to spit out more and more snakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*SPOILER ALERT* So everything\&#39;s going well at the end, and I\&#39;m willing to overlook the fact that some of these snakes all of the sudden turned out to be 25 feet long. After all, people are getting eaten, so it\&#39;s all good. But then all of the sudden, and I\&#39;m not going to tell you how because that would ruin the best part, one of the snakes is about 300 feet long. Then it proceeds to squeeze and devour the train, with all the graphic artistry of Serpentaur from the old GI Joe cartoons. Unfortunately, I could not make a Nemesis Enforcer connection with this movie. Anyways, so you would think that a snake that big, who ate a train, would be pretty unstoppable. Well not if you know your Mayan voodoo rocks and have the ability to summon tornadoes from heaven. Yeah, that\&#39;s all I\&#39;ll say about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, this movie is bad. Really bad to the point where you might be numb after watching this, or your brain might hurt. I didn\&#39;t give this a one, because no matter how stupid it was, it still wasn\&#39;t as bad as Date Movie. So if you like camp or badly constructed B horror movies, this is the one for you. If you think this will actually be cool like its bigger, more infamous brethren, just walk away from the box if you see it. And I\&#39;ll leave you with a quote from the movie that should basically sum it all up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Snakes can\&#39;t get on a train!&#34; Because that\&#39;s just silly. Not like they make stops or anything....&#39;
b&#39;A VERY un-Tom and Jerry short. Jerry narrates this tale that revolves around Tom the cat falling in love and losing her to his rival, Butch. Tom is best friends with Jerry here which irked me a bit. The cartoon is also presented in Cinemascope. Overall I found this Tom and Jerry cartoon sad and depressing. The should have just put &#34;Puss gets the boot&#34; on the DVD instead and I would\&#39;ve been happy. This experimental animated short can be found on disc 2 of Warner Brother\&#39;s 2-DVD Spotlight Collection set. It\&#39;s the last one on the set and I\&#39;m hoping that Warner Brothers chooses to release a second Volume soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Grade: C-&#39;
b&#34;USA&#39;s AZN TV purchased the rights to this film and the network is showing it using the English title THE PICKPOCKET.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1997&#39;s THE PICKPOCKET takes amateur home-movie style movie making to amazing levels of unpleasantness. The movie depicts a long-winded series of boring wanderings of an uninteresting, confused guy. This lead character, Xiao Wu, does not simply walk about aimlessly. Viewers will unfortunately soon realize that Xiao Wu has an unsurpassed talent to seek out, and remain dormant near the most obnoxious noises to be found in China. Clanging empty tin buckets being beaten with a stick -- he is there. Every old motor in China clunking in agony -- he is there. A crying baby? Yes, you guessed it, he is there! According to THE PICKPOCKET, China is the most irritating unpleasant sounding place on planet Earth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only element worse than the sound of THE PICKPOCKET is the photography. The camera shakes, shakes and shakes some more. Finally, the camera stills, but then it falls to the actor&#39;s knees and just stays there until someone in the crew realizes the mistake and begins to shake the camera again. Most of the shaky film is framed in distant, long, long, long shots. The few times when the camera gets somewhat close, nothing compelling ever takes place to connect the viewer with what is happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The photography is murky, faded and often blurry. The use of color is -- well, there is no sign of intelligence controlling the use of color. Most every shot is held 20 times too long. Few movies are so painful to sit through. This film is painful to watch, and painful to hear. And then it simply ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John Woo fans might enjoy being able to hear part of the soundtrack to DIE XUE SHUANG XIONG (THE KILLER) as the lead character is hanging outside of a video store for many minutes. Anyway, be warned -- THE PICKPOCKET will steal away your good time.&#34;
b&#34;I have just seen Caribe a couple of nights ago at the annual Vistas Film Festival held here in Dallas, and I must express my discontent. The opening caption tries to tell us that the film is a portrayal of the current invasion of South American countries (Costa Rica, in this particular case) by North American oil companies, and the negative effects, both economic and environmental, of this invasion. The main characters are a married couple who live a simple, pleasant life maintaining a banana farm. Right away, a woman arrives and announces that she is the wife&#39;s half-sister. I&#39;m not going to go into specifics about this (and to be honest, I don&#39;t feel that I&#39;m spoiling anything with this review), yet another key point is that the company to whom they distribute their bananas drops them due to budget demands in a poor economy. So, the main conflict that is supposed to be addressed in the movie is of the husband between the rock and the hard place, trying to preserve his livelihood. On one hand, the Reynolds oil company has basically offered him employment and financial compensation (basically a bribe) to use his public influence to encourage the town to allow the company to begin drilling in their town (compromising his standing with the community and the community itself). On the other hand, he is faced with being dead broke, but on the side of his community, protesting the drilling. Given the length of this film, it would have been ample time to explore the issues just described, but it just doesn&#39;t happen, and I&#39;ll tell you why. You will notice that this film has won a couple of awards so far, one for direction and an audience award. I&#39;m not going to pick apart Esteban&#39;s direction, it wasn&#39;t bad or good enough for me to be all that passionate about writing anything. The audience award was at a film festival in Spain, and for it to gain an audience award, I&#39;d have to imagine that Spanish people just dig soap operas. In fact, Central and South America dig soap operas as well, I know that much. I assume that Esteban was either aiming to take advantage of this or that he himself digs soap operas, because that is what unfolds over the course of this film, so much to the point that it kicks the whole oil company plot to the side, almost as if they imagined halfway through the making of this film that it had become tiresome, because it seems like at least three of the supporting characters have had their back story and character development severely compromised to make room for more sex and crying scenes. The only true villain in the movie is one of these three characters, and at no point do you actually get to find out who the hell he is. It&#39;s almost as if they cut his screen time just short of taking him out of the film entirely. From time to time, they toy with the oil against community plot, but these are digressions at best. What we see a lot more of are scenes of passion, jealousy, betrayal, adultery, etc. These themes saturate the story to such a degree that the oil company &#39;sub&#39;plot becomes unnecessary. It&#39;s almost as if this was a stunt to legitimize a romantic drama (soap opera) by throwing in a little political relevance. Nevertheless, the film gets so caught up in the romance that it ultimately doesn&#39;t know what to do with itself, resulting in an ending so tacked on that you&#39;re left wondering what it is that you&#39;ve been waiting around for, or if there was ever anything to begin with. Here are two things that I think could have saved this movie: either cut out the half-sister or cut out the oil company. It&#39;s obvious which one of the two they were more interested in. Or, perhaps if Caribe had been an hour longer, they could have worked this all out. Regardless, I&#39;d have been fine with a straight-up soap opera and I think that the subject of oil companies exploiting foreign nations is in dire need of addressing by the film community. Caribe is both and neither. These two angles could have worked together had they been balanced accordingly, but with a romantic plot running around in circles and taking up almost twice as much time as necessary at the expense of an oil plot that&#39;s barely been established to begin with, both sides suffer. Best of all, the romance plot is never even resolved. I&#39;d like to say I&#39;d watch this movie again to see what I&#39;ve missed, but I have a strong feeling that I already know what it is. As far as I&#39;m concerned, it wouldn&#39;t matter if I saw Caribe ten more times. I&#39;ve missed it because it is simply not there.&#34;
b&#34;Ever once in a while I run into a movie that is so embarrassingly bad I wonder why movies exist. This is one of them. This is a terrible attempt to parody The Godfather with annoying cartoon sounds, and bad dialogue. Eddie Deezen is just plain annoying as Tony, an annoying twit who upon his father, Don (William Hickey)&#39;s request, takes over the family business. Tony, as I said, is an annoying little twit. This makes the whole movie a complete mess. The movie is terribly daffy. It&#39;s too cartoonish. The main point I&#39;m trying to make is that you can&#39;t make a parody of an acclaimed drama like The Godfather with so much cartoonishness. It doesn&#39;t work that way. Believe it or not, you have to take a parody of a dramatic movie seriously. If you don&#39;t take it seriously, it will feel too much like a parody. The thing about doing a parody is that you can&#39;t seem too much like you&#39;re doing a parody. You have to make it seem like you&#39;re taking the movie at least a little bit seriously. It also feels like they&#39;re just mocking Woody Allen, and that&#39;s what makes this movie absolutely terrible.&#34;
b&#34;Tonight&#39;s film course film was The Legend of the Suram Fortress and during its 87 minute running time it managed to quickly jump into my top five most difficult films of all time. That&#39;s difficult to watch; films so different to everything else that you&#39;re seeing something totally alien. A brief synopsis would be: a group of Georgians are trying to build a fortress to defend themselves from invaders, but every time they are about to put on the finishing touches, for no readily apparent reasons it collapses. So they go and see a fortune teller who advises them that if they want to get the fortress to stay standing, they need to find a youth, a tall blonde blue eyed boy to be buried into one of the walls during the construction and his presence will ensure that the construction job will be completed smoothly. And sure enough in those closing moments there he is gladly being smeared in cement and eggs, giggling as he&#39;s buried alive, with only his mother to grieve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It actually a fairly simple story. But the director, Sergo Paradjanov, working in Soviet Georgia in 1984, not too long after leaving a fifteen year jail term, doesn&#39;t follow any of the film making rules we are used to. There are very few close ups. Very often the action we need to be following is hidden in the bottom left hand corner of a landscape shot, extra-ordinarily easy to miss. There are very few close ups and at times its hard to tell whose doing what to whom and why. Every now and then the film goes off on digressions which have no relevance to the main plot and generally serve to confuse the viewer. The music is utterly mad, with found sounds, on screen instruments and church organ dropped in seemingly at random. At times when nothing seems to be happening, someone will break into a jig, almost playing time until the next scene comes along. But infuriatingly there is an obvious cinematic voice behind it all so you&#39;re compelled to try and understand the message whatever it is. One of those times when your eyes are glued to the screen simply because you can&#39;t believe what you&#39;re seeing.&#34;
b&#39;I managed to see this at what I think was the second screening in the world, a few days after its opening at the Dublin International Film Festival. While I was attending another film two nights later at the same theater, I saw Brendan Gleeson, Paul Mercier and the rest of the cast &amp; crew at another promotional screening of Studs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that I was bitterly disappointed with the film, I was by no means expecting a masterpiece, but what was presented to me, I believe lacked all the crucial elements of the genre it had set itself into. Before I continue, two things, I accept that some filmmakers like to subvert generic expectations, here this is simply not the case. Secondly, I know that it was based on a play (which I haven\&#39;t read but have been informed that it isn\&#39;t a shimmering piece of literature), but this does not excuse the massive narrative problems that permeate the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main problem with the film is the script, forget that it was based on a play, as a sports comedy it simply doesn\&#39;t work, the down and out team are trying to win a football cup, few of the games are shown (when they are, it is very short) and we are not given any satisfaction due to any of their sporting achievements. Having read so far, you might assume that it is not a strict sports film but a psychological study of the relation between a &#34;charlatan&#34; of a manager and his hopeless team. It certainly does not achieve this, I\&#39;m not even sure if it was aiming to. Any attempt to shed light on the history of any of the characters is hackneyed and peripheral. Overall, I found the script lacking in many respects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think the performances and the music were good and technically, the film was well made. But aside from those points, which should be expected from any Irish film at this stage, I left the theater feeling very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My judgment may seem harsh but I do think there is some hope for a strong national Irish cinema in the near future and this simply does not back that argument. As Studs has become a recommended Dublin Cineworld film (I was part of the audience at that screening), most people would seem to be disagreeing with me, so that means you should probably make your own judgment of the film.&#39;
b&#39;How could they take such a beautifully animated gem like Don Bluth\&#39;s All Dogs go to Heaven and bastardize it with a charmless, cheesy, uninspired sequel. The haunting music and delightful characters are gone, now replaced with tacky animation and an unimaginative plot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pros: Charlie Sheen is sometimes fun as Charlie, but he lacks the charming tough guy attitude that brought him to life by Burt Reynolds. I did particularly enjoy the songs &#34;I will always be with you&#34; and &#34;It\&#39;s too Heavenly here&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cons: There seems to be no connection between this and the original. In the beginning Charlie is chums with Carface, but wait a minute. Isn\&#39;t this the same character who was responsible for Charlie\&#39;s murder and kidnapped the sweet little orphan he loved? I guess that all changes in Heaven but why isn\&#39;t Anne-Marie even mentioned? If Itchy makes it to Heaven, wouldn\&#39;t Flo and Killer make it too? What is with Annabelle the whippet\&#39;s voice? In the original it sounded feminine and charming and in the sequel it sounds like a whiny, bitchy, parrot. The new characters aren\&#39;t all that great (except Sasha). And the animation is better compared to a generic Saturday morning cartoon. The constant cartoony &#34;humor&#34; is flat and unfunny and the &#34;heart&#34; just doesn\&#39;t work when compare to the original, which had such a moving unsubtle touch that makes me cry every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All Dogs go to Heaven is one of my all-time favorite films. How Don Bluth allowed this sequel to be made is beyond me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE: Not all sequels go to Heaven.&#39;
b&#39;What an uninteresting hodge-podge. It could have been something more but no imagination seems to have gone into the script or the direction. A man is framed for murder by his wife and her lover. The conspirators do a pretty thorough job of making him look guilty. But the man (Richard Thomas), whose psychiatric records reveal him as &#34;stable&#34; and &#34;unimaginative&#34;, manages to escape from jail, beat it to the conspirator\&#39;s beach house, and secretly record a conversation between them in which they reveal their guilt. Then he accidentally drops the tape recorder with all the evidence on it into the sea water but manages to retrieve it. He shows a heck of a lot of creativity and improvisational skill for an unimaginative guy, if you ask me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tape is now damaged goods but it\&#39;s enough to break down the wife\&#39;s lover and he sobs out his confession. Bad people are punished. Good people are saved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The location shooting is impressive. The beach house is nothing more than a wooden exterior thrown up on the grounds of Fort Fisher Battlefield on the Cape Fear peninsula. The house was torn down immediately after the production wrapped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s a pretty place. Unfortunately it\&#39;s a little hard to see because someone seems to have shot every scene through a pair of pantyhose stretched over the camera lens. It\&#39;s all very fuzzy. And for all the natural splendor of the location the viewer never gets a real sense of place, of what the sand feels like, of the texture of the gray bark on the stunted evergreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting is okay but the performers have nothing much to work with. The best performance, as is often the case, is given by Dick Olsen as a sleazy but not unsympathetic defense lawyer. Virginia Madsen radiates infidelity with every beat of her eyelashes. Ted McGinley is within his range as an immoral weakling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The musical score neatly blends the ominous with the mysterious and is effective. If you want to hear the original, from which this was ripped off, rent Hitchcock\&#39;s &#34;Vertigo&#34; and listen to Bernard Hermann\&#39;s suspenseful theme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can\&#39;t think of any particular reason to catch this one except utter boredom.&#39;
b&#39;According to &#34;Lucien Rebatet&#34; in his &#34;Histoire de la Musique&#34; (Robert Lafont, BOUQUINS 1973 page 338) Beethoven\&#39;s character was not very compatible with women. He had quite a number of &#34;Platonic Passions&#34; with female members of the &#34;Vienese Aristocracy&#34; to whom he dedicated some &#34;sonatas&#34;. But Musicians , even composers did not qualify for Husbands of &#34;Fine Ladies&#34;. Haydn was a &#34;servant&#34; of Prinz Von Esterhazy, Mozart died from drink or Poison and Bethoven was according to Rebatet a frequent customer of &#34;street prostitutes&#34; in Vienna. A British biographer, Newman says that Beethoven contracted syphilis, before he was 40. That he became deaf because of that, is possible, but not certain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ninth Symphony was premiered on May 7, 1824 in the K\xc3\xa4rntnertortheater in Vienna, along with the Consecration of the House Overture and the first three parts of the Missa Solemnis. This was the composer\&#39;s first on-stage appearance in twelve years; the hall was packed. Although the performance was directed by Michael Umlauf the theater\&#39;s Kapellmeister, Beethoven shared the stage with him quiet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what remains of this &#34;Female Fantasy&#34;. Ed Harris interpretation and characterization are quite good, but too linear, based on the Painting by Ferninand Waldm\xc3\xbcller date 1823. I have it in front of me. It shows a man that despises (perhaps hates) the World. With good reason.&#39;
b&#39;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, great costumes and a wonderful `feel\&#39; for Pre WWII Italy. But what happened here? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great actors...Kristin Scott Thomas, Sean Penn, Anne Bancroft, James Fox, Derek Jacobi ...if you can\&#39;t get memorable performances out of this `A List\&#39; then the problem with this movie must be blamed on pitiful direction and an inadequate script. I rented this on DVD after having liked &#34;Angels &amp; Insects&#34; (1995) also directed by Philip Haas. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yipes! I can hardly believe how dull this thing was. It just dragged on and on and no one was able to save the poor thing. This is not even a good intriguing-foreign-dudes-and-young-things-in- pretty-clothes chick flick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Tea With Mussolini&#34; Gone Amuck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;
b&#34;Mild spoilers below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The prospect of war was clearly on the horizon when TFW was filmed. From the opening scene of European refugees to the final prediction that Naziism will be the death of millions of Germans, this movie is as much a propaganda film as the films made after Pearl Harbor. There isn&#39;t a lot of entertainment value here though the footage of the dust bowl is interesting to those of us who aren&#39;t old enough to remember it. The rest of the plot is pretty forgettable with the Herr Docktor Coburn - with a pretty bad accent - and daughter assimilating into America with Wayne&#39;s help. Other than the dust bowl scenes, the only memorable aspect of the movie is one best viewed with hindsight. Coburn&#39;s speech comparing Naziism to a malignancy worse than cancer and describing the (then current) successes as a momentary outburst of energy from a patient right before death were eerily accurate and Varno&#39;s Dr. Scherer played accurately to post war newsreel footage of unrepentant Nazis justifying their actions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When viewed from a historical perspective, some aspects of TFW are interesting. If you look at it for entertainment outside of the WWII perspective, you&#39;d have to say this is one of Wayne&#39;s less successful efforts.&#34;
b&#34;before seeing this film, the 1998 version was my only experience of this dickens story. i didn&#39;t enjoy that film very much, but this 1974 adaptation moves on in a particulary tiresome fashion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the actors don&#39;t shine, the main couple michael york and sarah miles are especially wooden cases. the only character of real interest for me was anthony quayle&#39;s intelligent jaggers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the so called plot is ridiculous, but the story itself is a great one. it&#39;s a real lesson on how your distorted values and obsessive principles can destroy you. live with an open mind and don&#39;t care what other people say, you are what you are, if others can&#39;t take it, **** &#39;em. pip was told this early on, but he didn&#39;t listen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the girl adopted by the weird old lady reminded me a little of the old kaspar hauser story, not in that same horrible level, but in the way she molded the child to create the executor of her personal vendetta against the entire opposite sex she thought had deceived her. pip&#39;s childhood didn&#39;t appear much better. the ending didn&#39;t seem to fit the rest of the story&#39;s style. the sets looked cheap, and coming to imdb i&#39;m not surprised to see that this was indeed a tv-movie (which i had no idea of when i borrowed it from the library).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;live and learn. so many good movies, so little time. that&#39;s why the reviews are here. so YOU wouldn&#39;t have to waste your time on this sort of movies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/10&#34;
b&#34;I love B movies, but I like to be aware from the beginning that I&#39;m watching one. I can&#39;t believe someone could mess up a movie about aliens and predators so bad. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aliens and Predator are AWESOME. This movie made a big joke out of them. The creators didn&#39;t take this movie seriously at all. I am throughly disappointed in how the Strauss jerks handled this film. They made a mockery of amazing characters. It&#39;s like they were trying to be serious in the beginning, then their writers got high and gave up. Almost nothing was continuous, the main characters were awful and were NOT Aliens or Predators. I am so ridiculously sad that no one takes Alien and Predators seriously anymore. These characters are icons of American pop culture and the creators of this movie showed no respect to the original films. They should not be allowed to cash in on the names of the previous films and they should be ashamed of themselves&#34;
b&#34;Chupacabra: Dark Waters has to rank as one of the most insipidly moronic movies ever made. I had expected at least some passable entertainment because John Rhys Davies was involved, and after seeing this movie, I can honestly say I lowered my opinion of Mr. Davies substantially.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why? The acting is incredibly poor. An excellent actor like Davies should have demanded more from the cast and the director. It was painfully obvious that Mr. Davies was just clock-watching and hoping the check would not bounce. To say that he just showed up would be an understatement. But at least he did show up. The rest of the cast looks like they mailed it in from their respective jobs at the various Los Angeles restaurants where they work as waiters. Talk about a cast of unknowns! This is the kind of cast that never appears in movies again. They act as if they were auditioned while waiting at the unemployment office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What about the special effects? Store bought firecrackers, Styrofoam, a cheap rubber suit and CGI effects that look like they came from my 1980 Atari Game. I have seen some horrible special effects used on Sci-Fi Channel movies, but this stuff looked like cut-and-paste done at the kindergarten by someones&#39; child. I expected Mr. Crabs and Sponge-Bob would show up at the end to battle the Chupacabra. Not to mention that all the accounts of the creature describe it as a small gremlin-like critter. It would have been a good film for a Leprechaun-like character. Instead, we get a gigantic hulking creature that is shown walking with stop-action speeded-up effects that are laughable. The chupacabra is in one place and then it shuffles at super-speed down the hall and it is worth a few laughs just to see this.&#34;
b&#34;Was it really necessary to include embarrassing footage of non-participants in a documentary. And why all the silly dog scenes, and then repetition of all the same silly dog scenes? This film starts with a great promise - to expose the international politics and the business of wine. It got off to a great start and included all the right characters. But the production is a mess. Points started and developed most of the way, then never finished or left with dangling ends. Very poor and disorienting camera work and editing. They should have used subtitles for the British mumbler from Christie&#39;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too much fluff and not enough fact for a documentary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably honored at Cannes because of the US bashing (although in my opinion there was too little of it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We left at the 2:00 hour mark - I have no idea how much longer it ran on.&#34;
b&#34;Recap: Since the warrior queen Gedren raised and slaughtered most of Sonja&#39;s family, she has trained in the art of sword fighting. Now, Gedren has taken a very powerful talisman, that threatens to destroy the world if not destroyed, killing Sonja&#39;s sister in the process. Now Sonja is out for revenge, and to save the world. Along the way, she meets the very Conan-like (but not Conan, no!) Kalidor, the child-prince Tarn and his bodyguard Falcon. At first Sonja declines all help, but is later forced to accept it, and together they go to save the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comments: When you watch a movie like this, and you think that it is the story that the is the best element in this movie, the movie is in big trouble. Because 1) a movie like this should draw its strength upon good swordfights and effects, and 2) the story is really, really bad. It is simple, and uncomplicated and really offers nothing in way of character development or even suspense. It is predictable and boring, and the obvious couple, Sonja and Kalidor, has no chemistry at all. And the kid is just annoying. And most of the scenes is drawn out so long that they become boring. Though the movie is not very long, it has not material enough to fill its time. And so back to point 1). The fighting is slow, uneventful and really bad. It clearly shows most fighters clearly blocking the opponents strokes far ahead of the opponent has even begun to strike. In my honest opinion, I believe most kids, fighting with sticks, creates more exciting fights playing knights than this movie did. All in all, this is a really bad spin-off, that should be avoided by all who liked the Conan-movies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/10&#34;
b&#39;This is one of the more unromantic movies I have ever seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Casting: Richard Gere is just too old looking for romantic lead roles anymore. Diane looks a bit eager to please and frowning as usual but she seems unconvinced by the romance herself. Supporting cast not too memorable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Story: The medical drama he has to deal with is unconvincing and is not interesting. The story is weak - not enough happens to make a movie about. There is nothing new to say or no new way to say it here. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The setting is a little bleak and the house it is set in is unattractive. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOT destined to be a great one to remember.&#39;
b&#39;The White Warrior is definitely one of,if not Steve Reeves weakest films. Set in 18th or 19th century Russia (??) Steve plays a cossack warrior who tries to over run a mad man Russian czar by running up a mountain side with his rebel band in a goofy looking Russian white tunic..... For the most part the great Reeves physique is hidden in a goofy, knee length tunic, with an even more sillier looking russian hat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The action is rather minimal, with only a good wrestling scene from the mid waist up that shows off the great Reeves physique. This is an apparent attempt by the producers to move Reeves out of the sword and sandal genre into another historic era, with poor results. The dialogue from the script is hard to understand at various points, and only commentary from the narrator allows the viewer to understand what is really happening from scene to scene. I would image Reeves regretted making this film, but in an attempt to try and get out of his toga and sandals and tribune armor it helped launch him to other historic characters such as Morgan the Pirate and the Thief of Baghdad.&#39;
b&#34;In this film, we&#39;re invited to observe the descent into a moral and emotional funk of someone who isn&#39;t likable to start with. What was the point of making the film, then? To show that it would have been better not to have had IN COLD BLOOD - a book I admire, incidentally - in order to have kept our hero&#39;s integrity intact? Hardly. He behaves at the party at the start of the film exactly in the same way he behaves after his triumphant reading from the book, so his degradation is a matter of degree. Are we supposed to care enough about Capote to take seriously his claim that he and murderer Perry Smith are kindred spirits, with the former having had all the breaks while the latter had none? Mr Capote&#39;s plight didn&#39;t touch me at all, I&#39;m afraid, so if that was the central idea it was wasted on me. But even if I could fathom why the filmmakers visited this pointless project on us, the clunky storytelling would still have bored me as it did. Hoffman gives a bravura performance to no emotional effect, while Keener and Cooper are so warm and interesting that I was yearning for more of them. Dreary beyond belief.&#34;
b&#34;This is possibly one of the worst movies I have had the dis-pleasure of watching in my entire life. The plot is ridiculous and the characters are horrible people. I watched this film with 3 friends and we all agreed to turn it off 30 minutes before the end. Ben Kingsley&#39;s character is just plain stupid but not funny at all. It is a wonder why an actor of his talent would be involved in such tripe. Tea Leoni does a fine Hillary Clinton impression throughout to portray the very cold and uninteresting female lead who has all the endearing qualities of a broom handle. Throw in a pointless and unexplained sub-plot and a horribly cringe worthy montage, and you end up with a waste of 93 minutes (60 in my case). Avoid this film at all costs!&#34;
b&#39;Writer/Director Brian Burns has obviously seen a few romantic comedies, and he seems to think that he\&#39;s discovered the formula for success: plenty of location shots in New York (preferably in the winter), allusions to old Hollywood films (especially musicals), enjoyable musical soundtrack. Alas, all of this is mere compensation for Burns\&#39; lack of talent as a writer. (The great mystery of many writer-directors making independent films is not why they cannot get on with major studios, but how they get any backing at all for their films.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally our interest in romantic comedy is motivated by the lead characters, but the couple in this film simply has no appeal. This is not the fault of either David Krumholtz or Milla Jovavich; their characters are just poorly written. What we respond to in such classics as When Harry Met Sally or Annie Hall or older films such as His Girl Friday are quirks and flaws of the lead characters\&#39; personalities. Lacking the ability to create individuals, Burns gives us an after-school special inspired by Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How anyone can see Burns as the successor to Woody Allen is beyond me. I did not laugh once during this film, and the screen-play is full of echo chamber dialog (&#34;I want to paint the town red.&#34; &#34;You want to paint the town red?&#34;), which is the most tell-tale sign of someone who has no business writing for a living. In one of the early scenes, we see Krumholz\&#39;s actress girlfriend filming a mindless TV sitcom. It\&#39;s the only moment in the whole film that the dialog feels right; maybe that indicates what Burns talents are really suited for.&#39;
b&#34;I have seen this movie and in all honestly was quite disappointed. And in my opinion this movie lacks heart. I frankly didn&#39;t care what happen to the characters by the end of the movie. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was so much there they could have done with the movie that they didn&#39;t because they were either so rapped up in trying to be obscure and make some deep comment on life, or trying so hard not to, that the characters and story were completely lost in all of it. I have seen another picture by this director and enjoyed it well enough. But I felt this film lack of the whimsy and heart of the other and I was left wondering what the point was, or if the point of the movie was that it had no point. Honestly, while I didn&#39;t feel like tearing my hair out during the movie, I did remorse the lost time on the sad little film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no doubt that some people will love this movie, but frankly I didn&#39;t.&#34;
b&#39;This Movie Was In My Opinion Very Ignorant! There Is Only Foolishness As The Motivation Of The Caracters. The Police Procedure Was Unrealistic. The Caracters Generated No Sympathy From Me,The Story Must Have Been Written As The Movie Was Filmed. Unless You Like Police Bashing Stories Don`t Waste Your Time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;
b&#39;Although I am sure the idea looked good on paper, and it appealed to me when I first heard of it, this movie often lumbers along and falls flat, and when I watch it, I just want it to end. The bookend beginning and ending of the film about Lou having to babysit a troublemaker is contrived at best, although I found the tall cop part to be humorous. However, I found little to laugh at with the bottom of the barrel script that was thrown together for these two great comedians. I thought that it was a mistake to put them in a musical, and it reeks of &#34;Wizard of Oz&#34; rip-off (with the songs and black and white to color format). I wouldn\&#39;t recommend this film to anyone but die-hard A&amp;C fanatics. Anyone else will be disappointed, and they have many better films.&#39;
b&#34;If ever there was a film that can be considered a missed opportunity then that film is Galaxina. What could possibly be wrong in basing a sci-fi film around a sexy statuesque female android? Surely such a film could never be a complete waste of time? Well, sadly this movie is pretty close to useless. There are a number of faults with this production it has to be said, however, there are two basic problems that entirely destroy the whole enterprise. Firstly, this is a comedy with no funny bits at all, or at the very least a film where the potentially amusing aspects are presented in an incredibly unamusing way. Secondly, the title character is woefully underused. This may be because Dorothy Stratten was not really an actress but if so it was a terrible decision as she is still easily the best thing about the film. I don&#39;t think she really needed to be a great thespian to pull off the role of a sexy android to be perfectly honest. Anyway, what we are left with is a whole lot of mind-numbing comedy relief, which often is made up of hopeless spoof-type gags of the big sci-fi hits of the time such as Alien, Star Wars and 2001. It&#39;s badly written and not funny at all, and it doesn&#39;t even really have a plot to propel things along. The story basically is about a police space-cruiser that is sent to get a rock. That&#39;s it! Steven Spielberg once said that a high-concept movie was one whose plot line could be described in one sentence. What he didn&#39;t define was what you call a movie that can be described in less than a sentence - pointless maybe?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seemed like a sure-fire winner to me but it failed miserably. It seems to have been an attempt to spoof Star Wars and combine it with adult comedy situations. All it does actually achieve is to leave you cold and a little irritated that it wasn&#39;t close to what it should&#39;ve been. A Barbarella for the 80&#39;s this ain&#39;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shortly after this film was finished Dorothy Stratten was murdered in an appallingly violent and horrific way. And for that reason Galaxina has derived a considerable amount of it&#39;s cult interest. I just think it&#39;s a great shame that Dorothy didn&#39;t have a better film left to immortalise her.&#34;
b&#34;THEIR PURPLE MOMENT &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aspect ratio: 1.33:1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sound format: Silent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Black and white - Short film)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two luckless nightclub revellers (Laurel and Hardy) are unable to pay their bill, provoking violent retribution from a hot-tempered waiter (Tiny Sandford).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Typical L&amp;H scenario, less substantial than some of their best work from this period, but worth a look nonetheless. Stan takes center-stage this time round, caught up in a financial dilemma after holding back part of his wages to fund a night on the town, only to find out - too late! - that his aggrieved wife (Fay Holderness) has replaced his stash with worthless coupons. Some of the prolonged closeups of Laurel as he slowly becomes aware of the unfolding disaster reveal his genius for characterization and mime. 1920&#39;s morality is represented by Patsy O&#39;Byrne, playing a hatchet-faced busy-body who takes great joy in alerting L&amp;H&#39;s respective spouses (Holderness and Lyle Taho) to their husbands&#39; bad behavior. The ending fizzles, but the movie still has much to recommend it. Directed by James Parrott.&#34;
b&#39;&#34;Quit while your ahead&#34; is a phrase they never learn. Typical Hollywood sequel scenario: if the first film was only shocking, the second wasn\&#39;t, expect the third to be the worst thing to hit the screen this year. Even worse are the prequels, events of which were already explained in detail. If you haven\&#39;t seen to first two films you will not like this one. It\&#39;s like starting to watch Lord of the rings or Star Wars with the last trilogy movie. So &#34;stand alone&#34; this film is not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember in the first movie about Lucians revenge? Remember the second about the long lost savage brother? Well if you saw those two 5 min moments and paste them together you would get\xc2\x85 a 5 min prequel. But the creators ether thought these 5 min were vital historical events or just wanted to give a job to some actors, cast and crew and maybe make some money in the process. &#34;I have a loot of money, I make movies for a living and I\&#39;m bored. What will I do? I know! I\&#39;ll make a movie.&#34; So anyway you get this 5 min prequel and you stretch it for 90 min \xc2\x96 that\&#39;s this movie. And you know what will happen to the main &#34;immortal&#34; characters, so there is little suspense. By the way, all the drama of the movie is in those 5 min. The only thing that made my eyebrow rise was mom killing in the begging of the movie. Sick. The rest was Braveheart remix. If you want a comedy, see Braveheart first then this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I\&#39;m going to rant a bit \xc2\x96 the movie put me in the mood. Who invented the concept of &#34;vampire vs. werewolf&#34; in the first place? It\&#39;s older than I am and got old just as fast. And why do vampires look like Goth girls in heat, while werewolves look like psycho bears? Hiding bad films behind cleavage fails. Isn\&#39;t it about time we got some sane slimmer werewolves with an upright posture? How can their unchangeable werewolves even breed if they rip everybody into shreds? And why with all their powers the vampires didn\&#39;t rule the world? Blaa, blaa, blaa\xc2\x85 What a waste.&#39;
b&#39;Dorothy Provine does the opposite here: She keeps growing and growing. I didn\&#39;t detect any subtext, though. &#34;The Incredible Shrinking Man&#34; and other movies of its ilk during the period were parables about radiation, nuclear war, and other horrors. Provine\&#39;s growth is the result of an inept computer/robot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And who operates this computer but Lou Costello! I like some of his movies with Bud Abbott. But, though this is a pretty bad movie, he does fine without him. And Gale Green is an excellent foil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Green plays the pompous town big shot. He is Provine\&#39;s father. He is intent on being elected Mayor. So when his beloved daughter starts having issues, he dumps her. He doesn\&#39;t exactly dump her but gives up his battle against her longtime admirer Costello.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is pretty implausible: Costello is the local garbage collector.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The special effects are minimal. And the subplot involving the military is lame in the extreme.&#39;
b&#34;This movie is soo bad that I&#39;ve wasted way to much time already talking about it. Soo bad...really... ...BAD... and I&#39;m not even that critical... ..I&#39;m almost ashamed to admit to having seen it... Sandra&#39;s few minutes show you how far she&#39;s really made it... I mean really anything next to this is really Oscar worthy for her... I suppose the only way for her to look at it is there&#39;s no way but up after this one...I suppose she had to start somewhere... but really...soo bad... ...awful really... bad is too good a word for this s**t ....but I don&#39;t want to get mean now... but really how can u not after wasting 90 minutes... 90 minutes of my life that I&#39;ll never get back... 90 minutes I could have spent doing something better...like sitting on my butt and staring into space..that would have been time better spent... (walks away shaking head)&#34;
b&#34;For a while when I was in-between jobs I had a habit of watching all the late night talk shows. For a while I had a good selection: Conan, Leno, Letterman, Ferguson, Kimmel...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until I reached the 1:30 a.m. time slot. The time between Conan and X- Files, on SciFi. And the only show on at that time was (and curiously still is) Carson Daly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His show intrigued me at first. Youngish, casually dressed, and with the hip pedigree of an MTV host, I thought Carson would bring a younger aesthetic to late night. I couldn&#39;t have been more wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He has no comedic timing. His jokes are plainly unfunny, and his monologue a painful affair of self-conscious babbling. I began to think he simply wasn&#39;t capable of delivering comedy (and I am right, he isn&#39;t), but it became obvious over time that the writers on the show must have had it in for him. The writing was idiotic and much too overreaching and the skits screamingly bad. And towards the end of the show being in-studio, the writers had Carson drinking alcohol on the set with gusto on every show, an oblivious Carson grinning from emaciated cheek to emaciated cheek as he sloshed his way through interviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zero interview skills. None. He tries to be friendly/chatty, but ends up being boorish and rude. He talks too much. He cuts off his guests. He asks them rude or embarrassing questions -- if he can find a question to ask them at all. And as someone had already pointed out, the guests literally stare at him or squirm in their seats, clearly uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the show has left the studio and looks as though it were shot on one handy cam. Even still, Carson refuses to take the hint from NBC. At one point, Carson didn&#39;t even get a camera man, he had to film himself for an episode! Wake up, Carson...that handwriting is all over the wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see the show is produced by Carson. I can only imagine that is the reason it is still on the air, he pays for it himself.&#34;
b&#39;I knew five minutes after the monster made his appearance where his was going. But when I saw the beginning credits, I said &#34;oh my god, Bruce Boxlightner, Walter Koenig (from Star Trek). Gil Gerard (from Buck Rogers, and he\&#39;s almost unrecognizable), then I saw John Callahan who used to star on my favorite Soap, All My Childen. Put on a few pounds but he can still act. Then there was Veronica Hamill. too bad I didn\&#39;t sick around to see her in the film. I bailed out 20 minutes into he film. It was THAT bad. Never did see William Katt (from Perry Mason, and The Greates American Hero).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All these stars and one lousy film. I hope hey got their paycheck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad Bad Bad&#39;
b&#34;The opening credits are pure poetry and I have watched it several times. It had a corny 20&#39;s adventure feel to it. Of course Kathy is gorgeous, but that voice! Did she realize this was a talkie. One word--voice coach. Great film for chronic insomnia (along with a bottle of scotch).&#34;
b&#34;This movie is not so good as I thought it would be. There is no story whatsoever, no characters and some dialog would have been nice. The gore effects are good and it gets quite bloody at times but nothing over the top. It starts with an autopsy on a man and when that is over the scene with the girl starts. The music is a classic score and fits the movie very well. They should have made a 90 minutes version in which they could have had some time for character development so we can feel sorry for the person on the autopsy table. And some more info about the morticians would have made this movie far scarier than it is. Don&#39;t expect a scary movie but a nice, gory special effects reel.&#34;
b&#39;I saw this video at a friends house, and it was the lamest thing i have seen ever. i lost a lot of the little respect i had for NIN. very boring, and the music is as equally interesting. dont waste your time unless you are a hardcore NIN &#34;fan&#34;&#39;
b&#39;Dillon, Fishbourne, Reno, should have teamed up for a much smarter effort, because this one slides in the B-Category and could have been done with no-name actors and a much smaller budget, since anyway, 2 armored trucks and a wasted warehouse could not have coasted too much. Since the writers did not manage to come with a smart heist plan, they targeted the dramatics of the situation, but there was not much to exploit there either. Fishbourne and Reno do not bring anything to this movie except the media interest, they\&#39;re only expensive advertising. Dillon is OK, but this was a walk in the park. The choices of the main character, Ty Hackett, are quite uninspired and the final, with the &#34;reward&#34; is quite childish. Waste of time, money, actors and so on.&#39;
b&#34;We were excited to rent this one after reading a few reviews and seeing that it scored so highly here. Well, we got it home and could not believe what we saw. Its basically comes off as if its written by some hard up perverted old guy who could not help inserting his sexual frustrations and fantasies into an anime film that really lacks in plot and humor. The main character is all over the place... one moment, he is like an immature little kid, the next moment he is mature and intelligent, then heroic, then a perverted stalker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst part is all of the out of place sexual content. I have no problem with sex and dig a movie that has some good sexual energy, but this is just presented in a way that is creepy. Nipple slips, close ups of a girls crotch (many times) in white panties, or a swimsuit. It was totally out of place and it seemed as if the person who wrote it was trying to live out some fantasies through his cartoon characters. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were expecting something of a mature nature, but we just kept looking at each other and asking what the heck the point of this was... besides jiggling cartoon boobs and poor dialogue. If you want to see some cartoon characters cleavage and crotch&#39;s... this is for you. If you are looking for something beyond that, this movie was empty. The characters and dialogue were just plain irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;
b&#39;This one hardly compares to the space adventures of its time. Those being Star Wars and Star Trek. And while I am no fan of Star Trek, I recognize that this film pales in comparison to the series Trekkies ooze over. In fact, I would place Back to the Future in better light in terms of space and travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story is of a boy who is captured by space raiders (pirates). In a obviously fake and unentertaining battle, the captured boy befriends the pirates and even helps them. And slowly, one by one, those raiders die off. In the end, the boy gets to return home and the last remaining pirates escapes gravely wounded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting wasn\&#39;t that great. But what really is obvious is the total lack of interesting dialogue, effects, and storyline. How they even got 80 minutes of this is beyond me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to take a shot at it because it involves space, go ahead. But be warned. &#34;D&#34;&#39;
b&#39;**Warning - this review may contain spoilers ** &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea behind the character of Danny (Jet Li) is a good one - young boy is taken by hoodlum and raised to behave like a vicious pitbull, controlled mainly by whether his collar is on or off his neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the writer did not know how to deliver this idea within the constraints of believability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He has Danny meeting a blind pianist, Sam (Morgan Freeman), who has to be the most trusting fool a man ever was - along with his nit-wit, endlessly babbling, rather unattractive step-daughter, Victoria (Kerry Condon). I was stunned, by the way, when I learned Victoria was supposed to be 18 - she looked 25 or 30 to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazingly there is no romance between Danny and Victoria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Danny turns up again, wounded, what does Sam do but take him straight home. Danny is out for 2 days, but do these nit-wits take him to a hospital? Nooooo. I don\&#39;t know if they even called in a doctor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Danny is obviously not a mentally stable person, this is apparent from the get-go, yet Sam takes him into his home, where both he and his step-daughter could have been seriously harmed or even killed by this rather strange, young man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why Morgan Freeman took this insipid role in this asinine film I can\&#39;t even begin to guess. Surely Mr. Freeman is not that desperate for a paycheck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then we have Bob Hoskins as Bart, the gangster who &#34;owns&#34; Danny - now you talk about a son of a gun that\&#39;s hard to kill. The car Bart is in gets riddled with bullets that would have rivaled Bonnie and Clyde\&#39;s demise. We think he\&#39;s dead, but no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then we have another car accident - and yet again, ol\&#39; Bart escapes unscathed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to that, we also have Danny fighting half a dozen tough guys at a time, plus a scene where Danny has decided he doesn\&#39;t want to fight any more. I don\&#39;t care how much a person doesn\&#39;t want to fight, when it is down to the wire of you fight or you die, I think anyone would fight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said in the subject heading - this film is about 40 miles outside the boundary of reality as we have come to know it. It\&#39;s not just a case of suspending belief - it\&#39;s completely beyond that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore I never did understand why Danny\&#39;s mother who turns out to be a nice lady, rather than the prostitute Bart claimed she is, became mixed up with Bart and his gang and got shot. Maybe that was my fault, I got distracted right about the time that scene came on--but it seemed highly unlikely she and Bart would have ever crossed paths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars out of 10 - and that\&#39;s being generous.&#39;
b&#34;As was mentioned before in other comments, the major problem of NVA is that it cannot decide what it wants to be, slapstick of the cheapest kind or an honest parody of the East German Army. There are a couple of moments which are quite moving, for example when one of the recruits returns from the army prison in Schwedt with a completely broken personality. But in the end, Leander Hau\xc3\x9fmann goes for the infantile humour. No wonder the film flopped at the German box office as it&#39;s historically untruthful to the real situation in those training camps and led by an actor who is unfortunately incapable of giving a nuanced performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, there is the camera work of Frank Griebe who - as always - does a wonderful job. If it wasn&#39;t for his beautiful images I would have rated the film far worse.&#34;
b&#34;Well, that was sure a waste of Dave McKean&#39;s talents, wasn&#39;t it? Don&#39;t get me wrong: when it comes to graphic design, Dave McKean may be the best in the world right now. The layered, textured look he can accomplish with just a few pencil lines on rough paper make the efforts of people like Peter Greenaway and David Fincher look like what they are: hackwork. McKean has been the godfather of a revolution in the look of comics, film, even magazine ads which borrow the distinctive collage effect he has pioneered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this movie? It&#39;s junk. Complete junk. The story, from Neil Gaiman, is, unfortunately, exactly what Gaiman has been giving us ever since he ripped off Clive Barker for the first time: a pseudo-mythic, overblown dreamscape, populated by characters which have Titles in All Capital Letters rather than names. Everything is allegory, to the point that it is impossible to get any human drama, emotion, or empathy from anyone involved. People make pithy postulations, speaking in riddles which bring to mind what Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead might have sounded like if Tom Stoppard had suffered a debilitating stroke halfway through its composition. Really, Gaiman, get over yourself. You&#39;re not a prophet. You&#39;re a poser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;McKean&#39;s directing doesn&#39;t help - his pacing is poor, taking fully half an hour to actually rev himself up for the main picaresque plot, and then simply providing a disconnected sequence of events, none of them given any weight. The monsters don&#39;t menace because they&#39;re not foreshadowed, simply thrown at the screen. The plot doesn&#39;t engage because we don&#39;t really care about the rancid little protagonists. Half the dialogue, muttered into into shirt fronts and ubiquitous masks, is unintelligible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the visuals are pretty, and I&#39;m sure the fanboys will lick it up. Pity. Think of the amount of really good work McKean could have produced if he hadn&#39;t been stuck with this lame project.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grade: D/D-&#34;
b&#34;Dennis Hopper must&#39;ve been really hungry to do this movie. Atrocious special effects, very poor writing, cheesy dialogue, stupid-looking killer bio-robots. Never mind the blatent disregard for science. The awkward scene with the 2 young leads taking their clothes off. The best part of this movie was the pull-start cyber-penis on the wacked-out cyborg pirate captain. 2 out of 10 stars because I&#39;m in a generous mood.&#34;
b&#34;The moral of this show is that bad eating habits give people bad hair, bad taste in clothes, bad posture, bad jobs, and on and on. They are obviously miserable and loathe themselves. However, if they learn to eat broccoli, they will be wealthy, successful, and attractive. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TLC ought to be ashamed of themselves for this blatant exploitation of parental fears and guilt. If nutrition is really that important, they should be able to develop a show using honest and truthful methods. If they really believed in their computer simulations, I&#39;d like to see them do a double-blind test by finding some 40-year-olds, finding out what their eating and exercise habits were as children, and age-progressing the kids&#39; photos. Then compare to the real things. Hey, that sounds like a project for Mythbusters! Discovery Channel--are you listening?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TLC must stand for Tabloid Lies and Cons.&#34;
b&#34;If you find the hopelessly amateurish acting, the uninteresting story, the fake blood and all the mindless shooting bearable, then you may actually have a fairly good time watching this trashy, low-rent exploitation film. You might also want to check out a pretty good catfighting sequence that&#39;s offered, although it&#39;s not good enough to make the rest of the movie worth sitting through. (**)&#34;
b&#34;( HR is what Himesh is called in the movie, I think he likes it too. ) It&#39;s amazing how intelligent people, talented even fall in to the same trap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like Reshamiya. It&#39;s amazing what he has done. No one in recent years has come back from the wilderness and made a mark for himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I truly expected a great film ( What with the budget of 50 Cr and the cute actress ). As intense as Reshamiya is I thought, he would excel at a sentimental and an emotional role. Ironically he is depicted the same but for what care? Sheer incompetence, carelessness, awful acting, banal background music, insensitive direction make it a real pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blunders rule. ( Ex. How can German Police issue public instructions on a loud speaker in English? They communicate among themselves in English!) Unfortunately this incompetence has become the standard in main line Bollywood. There are some excellent directors but many a bad ones too. The worse thing is that the majority just doesn&#39;t care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Songs are the only saving grace...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#39;t repeat this HR and find yourself a good director ( low budget.. No problem).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The villain should really have shaved his head instead of the wig you know... after all it&#39;s a 50Cr movie.&#34;
b&#39;The story of Farewell to the King is intriguing. An American &#34;deserter&#34; (I had the impression he and his 3 comrades were only trying to escape capture in the Philippines as their desperate escape by raft to Borneo is not your classic desertion). But no sooner do they come ashore when they are discovered by the Japanese. Nolte\&#39;s character (a sergeant) has only moments earlier walked down the beach alone and was not noticed. And incredibly, no one noticed his footprints in the sand which would have led the Japanese right to him. But anyway, Nolte is taken in by a tribe of headhunters and becomes their king after defeating another tribesman. So he\&#39;s out of the war. Then the British commandos show up and want the tribe to assist them in fighting the Japanese.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, Nolte\&#39;s incessant hamming ruins an interesting story. Instead of acting like a former soldier thrust back into the war, now with a tribe of warriors under his command, Nolte acts like he was raised by the tribe. He speaks as if English is almost a foreign language, rarely using contractions. He makes sweeping gestures when he talks, and acts like he is one with nature, as if he was raised in the jungle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is plenty of action and many interesting scenes with the British interacting with Nolte and the tribe. But Nolte\&#39;s character is never believable. It always looks like he\&#39;s overacting. He needed to be a little more of an American soldier and a lot less of a tribesman. As it is, he comes across, not as a regal king, but as a lunatic who has forgotten who he really is. But that is not the intent of the film, as the script has him being admired and trusted by the British commandos. There is never any suggestion that the British thought his behavior was strange. He is simply viewed by the British as the defacto leader of the tribe. Thus, it always seems that Nolte\&#39;s character isn\&#39;t fitting in with what\&#39;s supposed to be happening in the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another actor might have done a great job with the role, delivered his lines believably, and made it an outstanding movie. But Nolte ruins the film by hamming up every scene and appearing to not understand what his character is supposed to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a waste.&#39;
b&#39;For the most part, I considered this movie unworthy of a comment, but the last 10 minutes prompted me to write one. You see, right then we learn (SPOILERS...if they can be called that) that the Devil\&#39;s emissary has no chance of properly preparing the domination of the world by his master, because he is not skilled at martial arts! &#34;Prosatanos&#34; has been lying in a hole for centuries, waiting for &#34;human greed&#34; to release him, only to be defeated in a simple one-on-one match against 54-year-old former karate champion Chuck Norris! Imagine what would have happened to him if he had taken on Jackie Chan... (*1/2)&#39;
b&#34;A rather disappointing film. The club scenes were ok, but over done. The plot was thin and boring. It&#39;s only redeeming features were some of the characters. The Chemist and The DJ were pretty fun characters. Tim Curry&#39;s character was just bizarre and stupid.&#34;
b&#34;Geesh, I never, ever, ever thought I&#39;d write the above four words. But, actually, she&#39;s the highpoint of this little flick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the movie was packaged when I rented it, it supposedly is a comedy about a girl who is kidnapped but doesn&#39;t have her medication, which keeps her stable. It sounded like a cute concept. For years, all we ever saw of Spelling was as Donna Martin in 90210 and an endless parade of dull, lifeless TV movies. It sounded like a chance for her to stretch a little, and considering that with her TV success and her rich daddy, she couldn&#39;t have any financial reason to do this movie, I figured she took the part because this must be a low-budget jewel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead, Spelling&#39;s part is small, and the bit about the mentally unbalanced kidnap victim is just one of several storylines. When she&#39;s not on the screen, the movie crawls so badly, I could&#39;ve sworn it was longer than the 85 minutes that were listed on the tape. This would&#39;ve worked so much better if Spelling&#39;s storyline had dominated, and it had been changed into a romantic comedy with her and Phil, the least irritating kidnapper.&#34;
b&#39;&#34;Paranormal State&#34; is an interesting show for most paranormal believers. I enjoy watching what the &#34;team&#34; has to say and what they &#34;find&#34;, however, I know that the entire show along with it\&#39;s build ups and story lines are completely set up. They go to real haunted locations and I suspect that they speak with actual witnesses. I commonly feel as I watch it that I am not watching non-fiction but an actual movie that is contradictory to reality. I personally would not advise or recommend anyone to watch this show unless you are a basic scare seeker. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interesting show. Stick to &#34;Ghost Hunters&#34;&#39;
b&#39;Why I disliked the movie, apart from the sheer ugliness of the actors themselves, is that someone might actually believe such crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, The Second Coming of Christ will be at the end of words, and when Jesus Christ will come on Judgement day he will not come as He did before, in human form. He will come in His full Glory as God and we shall be judged not only for our sins, but also for the consequences of our actions. Everyone will! Secondly, I have seen the eternal Gay pride illustrated in this movie with the all unquestionable &#34;I read the Bible last night and it\&#39;s not written anywhere&#34;. Well, it is. Moses cites on 3 different occasions that men who make love to other men, or women who make love to each other as if man and wife should be killed because these will never inherit the kingdom of God as they are foul! If it truly were for us to follow the Bible word for word there would be executions now, wouldn\&#39;t there? But I think misinforming people does more harm than this would... That was the in the Old Testament.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are lots of lunatics in psychiatric wards who think they are The Son of God, but to make a movie after it truly makes you think of how many idiots out there can make a movie.&#39;
b&#34;&#39;It&#39;s supposed to have got good reviews&#39; says the g/f. If so, I can&#39;t find them. She goes off to sleep and I endure. Michael Douglas as a good ol&#39; boy - now there&#39;s a new one. Matt Dillon all screwed up. John Goodman losing his cool. Paul Reiser running around in BDSM leather. Oh it&#39;s a riot all right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hitch is you&#39;re probably going to lose interest pretty soon on. Liv Tyler plays the femme fatale and critics complain she might not have the register for her part. But it&#39;s immaterial: this movie is not about character development. In fact I&#39;d go so far as to say there&#39;s no character at all. What you&#39;re supposed to appreciate here is the plot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one is &#39;bad&#39; in this movie. Some people wonder why all these &#39;stars&#39; - Reba&#39;s even in here for goodness sake - sign up for such a junky project. Odds are they thought it would be fun. Maybe they did have fun. Who knows? Hey - maybe they got paid good too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But you have to fork over money one way or another to see this turkey. And that&#39;s probably not a good idea.&#34;
b&#39;The brands in this film, like Suit Supply, take away from the story, cause it\&#39;s supposed to be set in the eighties. It\&#39;s not a very thrilling film. Also, the single from Intwine on the soundtrack is very bad, it has a chorus that is repeated numerous times\&#39;, like &#34;I\&#39;m a cruel man, I take it all away, I\&#39;m a cruel man I\&#39;m here to stay..&#34; Jeeez couldn\&#39;t those asswipes have come up with something better than that? I guess they wrote it in a couple of minutes..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s really annoying, just like the product placement in this filmproduct,that cashes in on the controversy and publicity around a criminal who should not be a celebrity like he is now made out to be, but should be forgotten like rats ought to be.&#39;
b&#39;The C class cast and poorly transitioned scenes, complete with terrible acting have led me too believe this would make a good TV only release such as the FX presentation of a smallpox outbreak. At my local blockbuster however, about 9 copies are held on the shelves, none of which were checked out when I rented the title (I wonder why....) Anyway, this title was almost ridiculous in the &#34;fear factor&#34; the director was going for. The whole &#34;death count&#34; on the bottom of the screen completely contradicted the plot at times, such as when the chopper was going over Angola, and the toll was speeding at a breakneck pace from 23 million to 24. However, as the movie ends, (possibly several hours or even a day or so after the chopper has landed) the death toll counter is reset back too what it was at the moment the chopper was approaching the area. The movies end left a huge whole in th entire plot, and god knows nobody is waiting for the sequel. Anyway, do not rent this, I only advise watching this if you have obtained the title with no monetary loss, and you are in the mood for a cheesy suspense movie.&#39;
b&#39;I got interested in this movie because somebody had made a beautiful video for Bj\xc3\xb6rks &#34;Bachelorette&#34; with clips from it. So I watched the movie. And it is indeed stuningly beautiful. A masterpiece of animation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the story doesn\&#39;t keep up. It starts out well, with interesting plotlines about people fencing for the possession of the Rose Bride, but suddenly elevators fill up with water and looses their walls, people float away, and finally for no reason whatsoever, Utena is tranformed into a car, and a highspeed chase ensues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like much Anime for it\&#39;s ability to make alternative universes, but this universe is just stupid. If you are gonna watch this movie, turn of the sound, it\&#39;s better that way.&#39;
b&#34;You&#39;re Dead is an indescribably awful attempt at a British gangster film. It has not got a single original idea in it, being an atrocious copy of various elements of Lock Stock &amp; Two Smoking Barrels, The Usual Suspects and Pulp Fiction. The acting and dialogue are absolutely excruciating, the plot is ludicrous and utterly predictable despite constant attempts at plot twists, and contains nothing but one dimensional stock characters and clich\xc3\xa9s. It has some good actors in it, but they are off-form, and unable to do anything much with the dreadful material they are working with. It is absolute torture to sit through this drivel.&#34;
b&#39;The movie &#34;The Cave&#34; has got to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. There was no plot, no story-line, and the lighting was terrible. For most of the movie, I was unable to make sense of the scenery as it was being highlighted by flashlights. The persistent \&#39;grey\&#39; spaces throughout the movie were irksome. The only scene that really came through clearly was in the cavern lit by what appeared to be a bad simulation of the conditions to be found in Hell. All in all, the movie was not really worth watching. If the producers cannot come up with something better than this, they should find another occupation. The underwater scenes were particularly awful, being mostly made up of bubbles and flashlights, with the occasional look at the actors. In summation, a really awful movie with bad lighting, extraneous flashes throughout.&#39;
b&#34;Yes sure, this is a Friday the 13th rip off but I have no problem with it. It&#39;s a good effort, the killings aren&#39;t that gory but the acting of one girl carries the movie, what a scream queen, Jennifer Ritchkoff. For a low budget movie the effects are nicely done, okay, sometimes you can guess how it is done. Some people have problems with the use of the camera, I can&#39;t see what&#39;s wrong with that. It&#39;s so strange that so many people dislike this movie, I really enjoyed it. Of course the script isn&#39;t original but give me one that is, I mean, so many slashers are made in the woods. maybe it is all predictable but it&#39;s a worth see, I have seen a lot worser, I can tell you that&#34;
b&#34;Son of the Mask is a terrible movie. I don&#39;t like the baby and I don&#39;t like the dog. Jamie Kennedy and his wife are a cute couple but that can&#39;t redeem sitting through this garbage. Even at only 88 minutes (or so it says), the movie could not end soon enough for me. The only real laughs come at the beginning with a brief appearance by Ben Stain. That&#39;s it. The rest is just a rehash of the first movie. Actually that is just an insult to rehashes. Why was this sequel made?? This movie cost millions of dollars to make. Why would I sit through a movie with a baby and a dog intentionally trying to drive the dad crazy? Jamie Kennedy is talented but he has nothing to do in this movie. I am not bothering to be nice to this movie. 1/10&#34;
b&#39;One of the commenter\&#39;s is wrong. This is not the only Pat Patterson film and he didn\&#39;t die two years after this was made. He shot a film called the &#34;Electric Chair&#34; in Pineville, NC. He shot this a few years after Doctor Gore. Patterson died in the late 70\&#39;s. I know this because he used my house and he left a cat there!! It sucked also. This was a big deal when the movie came out. No independent horror films were being made in NC. This movie didn\&#39;t help matters. Patterson used to do gore effects for H. G. Lewis. He was also good at magic. His gore scenes in Body shop were actually well done. The film was shot in a building that also housed a 7/11. You can actually see the tops of the walls in some scenes. The budget was less that $20,000 and the script looked like a child wrote it. Only Patterson could understand it. Still...it\&#39;s entertainment and it\&#39;s a classic.&#39;
b&#39;I am from Romania ... and for that i apologize if my English is not so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i just finished watching this movie and i must say that i am extremely disappointed. I always liked Wesley Snipes\&#39;s movies but this one is terrible. I regret that I spent over 3 hours downloading this film. There are a lot mistakes in the film. For example, the stadium in the film is not Lia Manoliu. The name of the stadium is Ghencea. The name of the soccer team is called Steaua Bucuresti, not Uli.The scoreboard of the stadium is not capable of showing graphical images: video replays, live images etc. It\&#39;s a simple scoreboard that can only display letters and numbers. The Uli(Seaua) team\&#39;s opponents are displayed on the scoreboard as Din ( probably from Dinamo Bucuresti - who are Steaua\&#39;s main rivals in the Romanian soccer championship). The images from the soccer match are from a match between Steaua Bucuresti and Poli Timisoara (my favorite team and my only love - look it up on the internet and you will see why). The police cars in the movie are not properly made. There isn\&#39;t a single dark-blue police car in Romania! They are all white! The &#34;mistake list&#34; can go on and on and on ... but i will stop here! In short terms this movie is horrible. It does not worth renting it, it does not worth buying a cinema ticket for it, it does not worth downloading it! I honestly feel sorry that Wesley snipes played in this movie. A previous movie of his ... 7 seconds ... also filmed in Romania ... was OK but this is terrible!&#39;
b&#34;I was really geared up to watch when two of best movie critics tagged this movie as a &#39;laugh riot&#39;. But the movie turned out be disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will be advised to watch this movie keeping your brains at home but you simply can&#39;t ignore the flaws and the shortcomings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The missile scene was total stupidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Katrina Kaif and Govinda pair looked awful. (He&#39;s 49 and she&#39;s just 24... more than double of her age) 3. Salman&#39;s comedy is less of acting and more of overacting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Songs are good but interrupts the pace of the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Some scenes were deliberately attempted by the movie makers to be funny, and 6. Poor and flawed story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, there are few pluses- 1. Govinda. Great Individual Performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Some scenes are actually quite funny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Kattrina Kaif. Looks and Acting keeps on improving with every film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Rajpal Yadav&#39;s Don sequences. Though under-utilized but hilarious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So 4 good points, 6 bad ones.. this one gets 4/10.&#34;
b&#34;I am a huge fan of Northern Exposure. Men In Trees is a complete knock-off of Northern Exposure. There&#39;s the city-folk from New York stuck in a remote backwoods town (Marin Frist / Joel Fleishman). She immediately doesn&#39;t hit it off with a local (Jack Slattery / Maggie O&#39;Connell). The town only has one pilot who is not often available. Ther is only one radio show. And the entire show is about quirky people with sincere and odd relationships. Too many parallels. Just like Northern Exposure except one obvious demographic has been altered in each character. I&#39;m bored. Give me something new to think about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the upside, the writing is pretty good. But if this was a school project, it would certainly have earned the stamp of plagiarism. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps people who love this show were sheltered from the dedicated creativity and hard labors of Joshua Brand and John Falsey.&#34;
b&#39;This film simply has no redeeming features. The story is incomprehensible, and the script is gross, sadistic, and stupid. The sex scenes are a joke, as is the inevitable car chase. The music is awful. The acting is limited largely to growling and smirking. A half star dud. Shame on DirecTV for putting it on pay-per-view. In a theater, people might well have thrown soda at the screen.&#39;
b&#39;A few buddies and myself have the strange hobby of seeking out really horrendous and utterly obscure (for a good reason) horror flicks and then subsequently watching them under the influence of mind-broadening consumer goods like alcohol and/or soft drugs. Surely a lot of people do this, but they watch movies like the &#34;Godzilla&#34; remake, whereas we torment our eyes and brains with stuff like &#34;The Loch Ness Horror&#34;. And, eureka, this is a prototypic bad movie! We open traditionally, with bag pipes music during the opening credits. This is, of course, to emphasize extra to us dumb viewers that the story is supposed to take place in the Scottish highlights and not in director Larry Buchanan\&#39;s birthplace Texas. For that exact same reason, the cast members are seemingly also instructed to overact tremendously and talk with talk with atrocious accents. The American marine biologist Prof. George Sanderson arrives in Loch Ness with some brand new and highly sophisticated sonar equipment to track down the whereabouts of the legendary monster in the lake. Meanwhile, there are many other parties hanging around the lake, like a group of kids on a Science Camp (what a boring way to spend your vacation), retired army generals looking for a Luftwaffe plane that crashed in the lake during WWII and a bunch of thieves and failed scientists that are steeling the monster\&#39;s egg. You would think that these numerous sub plots bring some diversity and excitement in the plot, but unfortunately that\&#39;s not the case. &#34;Loch Ness Horror&#34; is an overall boring flick with only a couple of noteworthy elements. The monster itself, for example, is a delightfully cheesy creation with cute eyes and a smoky breath. His teeth also glow in the dark, which is quite useful when you\&#39;re dumb enough to go out on a boat ride in the middle of the night. Near the end of the film, the remaining cast members were more interested in the lost Luftwaffe plane than in the monster, so it was about time to wrap it up. &#34;Loch Ness Horror&#34; is carefully recommended in case you\&#39;re a fan of bad B-movies from the 80\&#39;s, but be advised that it contains an overload of senseless dialogs and a bizarrely rushed ending that makes it look as if the film suddenly ran out of budget.&#39;
b&#39;...now please move on because that\&#39;s getting on my nerves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, the man behind brilliant pieces like &#34;My Own Private Idaho&#34; and &#34;To Die For&#34; (and others not so brilliant movies, i.e. the unnecessary &#34;Psycho&#34; remake) started an experimental phase with &#34;Gerry&#34;, which reached its peak with the thought-provoking &#34;Elephant&#34;. &#34;Last Days&#34; had some interesting aspects but was very uneven, while &#34;Paranoid Park&#34;, his new film, also has good-looking 15 year-olds walking around... and not much else. Some cool references to Fellini (the soundtrack reuses some beautiful pieces by Nino Rota) and the elegant cinematography by the legendary Christopher Doyle (&#34;In the Mood for Love&#34;) are the highlights, but the movie is just too artsy-fartsy and meaningless for its own doom. We\&#39;ve had much better coming of age stories, and &#34;Paranoid Park&#34; brings nothing new. I don\&#39;t see anything artistic about seeing excessive shots of Gabe Nevins in his underwear or showering. Or when Nevins and 13 year-old Taylor Momsen (the little girl from &#34;How the Grinch Stole Christmas&#34;), who plays his cheerleading girlfriend, have sex for the first time, just because she felt like they had to do it and after they\&#39;re done, she calls her friend to say how amazing it was (and you can say from Nevins\&#39; face how traumatic it was). Everybody knows that they\&#39;re starting earlier and earlier nowadays, movies like &#34;Thirteen&#34; and even &#34;Elephant&#34; itself (which shows how lost their minds are in general, not only when it comes to sexuality) have done a better portrayal of that. Gus tries to be minimalist and artistic, but the final result is just boring and uninteresting. His next project, &#34;Milk&#34;, a biopic about Harvey Milk starring Sean Penn, will, hopefully, bring the good old Gus back, because, frankly, this obsession over underage kids is almost... creepy. 4.5/10.&#39;
b&#39;This movie stinks. IMDb needs negative numbers in its rating system to properly evaluate this turkey. The acting is either wooden or over the top; the film was apparently NOT written by anyone in particular; and the monster scenes were mediocre at best. Even as a movie driven solely by the monster scenes, those shots were so disappointing that they could not inspire any sympathy for the rest of the movie. I want the 80 minutes of my life back that this movie stole.&#39;
b&#39;Not a terrible movie... But there are monster scenes where you will be rolling on the floor laughing - not a good thing for a action/thriller. The acting is generally pretty decent for a SciFi channel movie. Barry Corbin plays a credible US senator, and Lou Diamond Phillips again gives us a decent military/police/sheriff/agent/marshal figure. The special effects are well, &#34;special&#34; - for example, the external train shots are very obviously a model train.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goofs: A meteor strikes a stationary car in the opening scene. The car bursts into flames but does not budge an inch. After the impact, the meteor is lodged in the top of the car\&#39;s hood - impossible from the low angle that the meteor came in at.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spoilers...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good portion of the movie\&#39;s events are predictable, from the helicopter crash (&#34;Pull up, pull up!&#34;), to the fact that the annoying people get it in the end, to the classic blown bridge over a 1000 foot gorge awaiting the train, to the sequel set-up at the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scenes showing the aliens attacking are hilarious. They are vicious cute puppets and move at lightening speed - remember the Monty Python rabbit? Spoiler Goof: In one scene four people shooting clip after clip cannot hit a single creature because they move at lightning speed. Later in the movie Todd Bridges rigs up a mini flame thrower which he uses to dispatch a number of creatures at close range. On several occasions, Lou Diamond Phillips is able to easily grab creatures with his bare hands.&#39;
b&#34;I saw this on the shelves at the rental place and I have rented everything else so I said why not. Why not is because it&#39;s one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It looks like it was shot with home camcorder. I guess thats all the budget would allow. There was less boobs in it than I thought there would be. Some people made it out to be soft porn with a few killings. The funniest part of the whole movie to me is in the extra stuff. There is a spot with deleted scenes. Well there is only one but it is the dumbest and I think it may have brought the rest of the movie down. The girls get in a hot tub and find some chocolate syrup in the bathroom. Yes it ends up all over them. Great stuff !!! This movie is very very bad. Don&#39;t bother.&#34;
b&#34;Well I had the chance to view this film the other day. I didn&#39;t know what to expect as I never saw the trailer and such... but what I did discover simply by watching the first 10 minutes is that this film is the worst I have ever had the misfortune to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could give it this film a 0 rating. The first 10 minutes were bad but as soon as it goto the party scene I wanted to just enter a coma it was really poorly done. The actors didn&#39;t have any direction, there was no real story, I read some reviews that state its good if you have a little child to entertain for 90 minutes etc... but really why should we expose children to this type of film? Its got poor humor, rude and crude comedy at best and focuses on poor special effects to fill 80% of its time. I am sure a few people in Hollywood will be out on the streets after this film bombs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also How can 39 people give this movie a 10. I mean get real anyone that gives this movie a 10 either has some mental issue and or works for the film company. This movie should average at 1.5/10 instead of its current 2.3/10 due to the people that ranked it 10. Truly sad.&#34;
b&#34;This film may be great, but it is a complete ripoff of Bill Forsythe&#39;s Comfort and Joy. c&amp;j is one of the sweetest films I&#39;ve ever seen without becoming diabetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s OK if you do like it, but realize that EVERYTHING in this film is a direct rip-off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The original is http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0087072 I can recommend almost anything by forsythe - Local Hero, Gregory&#39;s Girl, That Sinking Feeling. I better go rent some tonight. Local Has a young Peter Capaldi, and an old Burt Lancaster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately he&#39;s given up film-making after some really crappy Hollywood treatment. Sad.&#34;
b&#34;In another of the dreadful horror films I seem so masochistically attracted to, we have a bunch of friends stuck in a haunted house slowly being killed one by one thanks to a horde of zombies that spurt yellow blood and have very bad dental problems. The first 45 minutes is all talk however, and considering the young thespians cannot act their way out of a paper bag and are given the most banal dialogue ever to dispassionately recite, this is especially painful to sit through. If you manage to stay awake through that nonsense, things don&#39;t get any better.. with bad make-up galore and cheesy, bargain basement (not-so-special) effects. As for the conclusion.. well, what&#39;s the betting that the old-timer who warned them against going to the spooky mansion in the first place will turn up and save the day for the last two survivors (a boy and a girl, of course) with his mystical powers? Please.. life is too short for these kind of movies. Donate the time you would otherwise have spent watching this tripe helping out the community, do a couple of shifts in a soup kitchen or something. You&#39;ll feel you&#39;ve actually done something productive with your life, and you won&#39;t have put money into the pockets of studios who churn out irredeemable rubbish such as this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it&#39;s already too late for me.. now, where did I put that copy of &#39;Pumpkinhead&#39;? 1/10&#34;
b&#39;May or may not contain spoilers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inuyasha is not a good anime. It\&#39;s actually very overrated. Why? There\&#39;s absolutely no story line, no plot, and the show just drags on... and on... and on... That\&#39;s because there are more side stories and fillers than episodes that make the plot progress. And the fillers are just the same stories being repeated over and over again. The same episodes seem to go with the same plot: Kagome sensing a jewel shard, a worm/slime/tentacle demon thing pops up, Inuyasha says &#34;Wind-Scar&#34;, &#34;Iron Reaver Soul Stealer&#34;, etc. and kills the demon, they get the jewel shard, and then we just repeat this scene 160 or more times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides the repeating of episodes, there\&#39;s the repeating of comedic devices, and they\&#39;re not funny anymore. Wait, they never were. Sexual harassment is NOT funny. Viz rated the series Older Teens, 16+. I have no idea why they rated it that. There\&#39;s nothing bad about it except for the so-called funny sexual harassment, which is kind of suggestive, and that could get you arrested these days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, this is how we know Inuyasha is overrated. The videogames. They all sucked. Especially the Mask game. I played that at my friend\&#39;s house. It wasn\&#39;t anything interesting. The game was slow, boring, and it had Nintendo 64 like graphics. In a magazine, it got a rating of 4/10, saying &#34;...this role-playing game is slower than milkshake moving up a cocktail straw.&#34; Then, there\&#39;s all these stupid Inuyasha toys, action figures, trading cards, stickers, and coloring books. COLORING BOOKS! We thought Inuyasha was 16+! Maybe not... But after being a member of Inuyasha groups on MSN, about half the people on there were 10 to 13. I guess Inuyasha is a little kid anime after all. (I think that just a small bit of editing done to this show, it could be shown on Toonami.) There are over 40 manga volumes. I can only help but wonder how many miles of forest that have been cut down to make them. Sad...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there\&#39;s the music. The music is so annoying. We hear the same 5 songs every episode. After 10 episodes, the music gets really annoying. In other anime, they have music to fit the mood and we don\&#39;t hear some songs very often. There are about 15 different Inuyasha soundtracks. Don\&#39;t waste your money on that garbage!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And how do you think I know all this? Because I used to be a fan of Inuyasha. I feel ashamed of myself. I\&#39;d rather watch Kim Possible or Pokemon instead. Sadly, those two shows have more romance between the two main protagonists than Inuyasha will ever have...&#39;
b&#39;Ed Wood is rolling over in his grave. He could have made a hundred cult classics for the price of this waste-hole. The worst script in memory (it makes &#34;X-Men 3&#34; sparkle like &#34;Citizen Kane&#34;); the most amateur directing; pre-K cinematography; the cheesiest &#34;special effects&#34; (I\&#39;m talking about &#34;Friday The 13th&#34; sequel territory); and throw in a pointless, revolting, deeply disturbed, maternity ward sequence. The lack of any talent or sensibility that put this garbage on-screen is astounding. That the &#34;industry&#34; might reward anyone involved in this celluloid cess-pool with future projects ought to be cause for serious alarm.&#39;
b&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It sucked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned the video after watching half of it. Not funny,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;just a cheap and desperate attempt to cash in on a very very funny original. junk, forget it, don&#39;t waste your time etc etc&#34;
b&#34;This movie was so awful that I can&#39;t even describe it. I was amazed that I even sat through this pile of trash. I couldn&#39;t believe that a movie like this was even thought of. It was a about a serial killer that clucks like a chicken. He doesn&#39;t just cluck a couple of times, he clucks non-stop through out the whole movie. He even flaps his arms like a chicken which is even stupider than anything I have ever seen. I couldn&#39;t believe this came out in 1990. I thought it came out in the early &#39;80&#39;s or something. Then the daughter isn&#39;t very smart either because she was protecting the geek or man chicken. The end just gets worse and is the worse ending I have ever seen. This movie is just chicken s**t. I was laughing more than I was scared and I strongly suggest going out and getting a bucket of fried chicken instead of seeing this movie.&#34;
b&#34;This film is striking only in its banality and use of cliches. Sadly it was obvious throughout up until the ending. But don&#39;t be mistaken into thinking that it ended strongly. Only a little unexpectedly, though nothing worth watching the thing through for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the taciturn and wronged hero, to the Germanic baddy, to the expendable team, the characters were entirely wooden and obvious. The two FBI agents Smith and Wesson (geddit?) gave some hope of humour, but that came to nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a big science fiction fan but it is hard to find any redeeming quality in this film. A turkey!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;
b&#39;Movies like these do not need sequels. Part of the advantage of Don Bluth moving away from Disney is that he didn\&#39;t need to suffer their endless tirade of straight-to-video, poorly animated cash-in sequels. But apparently it was someone\&#39;s brilliant idea to make a sequel to &#34;All Dogs Go to Heaven,&#34; so we get this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charlie Sheen replaces Burt and he\&#39;s not really as good. Most of the film is just a poor excuse for a sequel and it isn\&#39;t nearly as dark, different or entertaining as the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel sorry for future generations who are going to have to suffer endless sequels like this without ever knowing what it was like to have a time when Hollywood didn\&#39;t totally rely on successful films as a crutch to release banal crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please, no more sequels to kids films that don\&#39;t need \&#39;em.&#39;
b&#34;As noted in other comments here, the camera-work is laughably bad. I am tempted to say that the director of photography is a 7-year-old, but that would be mean -- to 7-year-olds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, but what about the subject? I was looking for some insight into the state of the wine industry worldwide, you know, Mondovino. What the film is about is a very narrow view of one intrigue in that world: the struggle between Mondavi and the French and Italian wineries that they would like to buy. There is no enlightening narration that would put the whole deal into context, so we are left with the selective process of the director and the interviews with the various characters in this little psychodrama. There&#39;s no shortage of despicable characters, or even despicable dogs, in sight. There is a shortage of evenhandedness, however. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is the director a Marxist? I wondered as I tried to maintain some semblance of focus as the camera dipped, swerved, zoomed in a chaotic flourish. Small grower in France: good. Huge grower in USA: very, very bad. Forget about the hundreds of small wineries throughout North America, Australia, and South America. There is a dead horse to beat here for over two hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To learn about the intrigue more, you are better off reading about it elsewhere. And you will be able to sample your favorite wine without feeling sick while doing so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest a new award at Cannes for Best America-bashing Diatribe.&#34;
b&#39;When I saw the poster at the theater, I thought that it is a &#34;new line&#34; of a horror story without a famous cast worth giving a try. But, after I went in, I wanted to leave after 20 minutes. There was a lot of non-sense and logical flaws. To me, it is a movie that is not worth putting in theaters. It is not even worth seeing.&#39;
b&#34;Ed Wood rides again. The fact that this movie was made should give any young&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;aspiring film maker hope. Any screenplay you might have thought of using to&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;line a litterbox or a birdcage should now not seem that bad. Do not watch this movie unless you have a healthy stash of Tylenol or Rolaids. Watching this&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;movie made me realize that Boa vs. Python was not that bad after all. It probably would have been better to do this movie in Claymation as at least that way no actor would have had to take credit for being in this film. It is understandable why this director has so many aliases. There is a bright side to watching this movie in that if you can get someone to bring you a bag of chips, then you can eat your way out of the cocoon of cheese that surrounds you enabling you to&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;make your toward your TV set&#39;s cocoon of cheese that surrounds it.&#34;
b&#39;Note to self. Never ever ever again watch a serious movie with Charlie Sheen in it. Great comedian, horrible seal. This movie makes Navy SEALS look like a reckless group of rangers when, in fact, they are the most elite form of military in the world. Charlie Sheen helps destroy the Navy SEAL reputation. Thank you for making such an incredibly select group of individuals look awful in one of the worst action movies I have ever seen. This is a great story which could be made into an amazing action movie, but why Charlie Sheen? There are possibilities for a very passionate story here, but Sheen decides to wreck them with &#34;funny&#34; comments.&#39;
b&#39;WEll first and for most I\&#39;d just like to say that I\&#39;m back out of retirement from writing well deserved comments about horrible movies. Only the movie in titled &#34;Scarecrow gone wild&#34; could bring me back, so here I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that being said, I like to start off with this comment. OUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This movie was really horrible, I mean I know it was going to be bad. But I had no idea that I would be spending 60 minutes out of a possible 90 minute film laughing at what I thought was a horror movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let\&#39;s start with the biggest flaw of the film (to me that is). Ken Shamrock. Now if memory serves me correctly, Shamrock is one of the worlds most dangerous men. Now if memory serves me again, he was also in this stupid movie being a stupid comic relief (or that\&#39;s how it looked to me). I mean how else do you explain all of his lines. My all time favorite line of his in this so called movie was &#34;It\&#39;s been a long time coming&#34;. OK????????? The funnest thing about that line was that no more then five minutes prior to him say that, he was sitting on the beach talking to the soon to be dead kids about how the dam scarecrow could not be killed. So if he has knowledge of this, why on earth would he start trying to combat it as soon as he sees it (the scarecrow that it). Like I said before, he must have been the comic relief, except I don\&#39;t think his UFC buddies where laughing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I\&#39;ve finished that well deserved paragraph on to the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\&#39;ll admit that I can\&#39;t remember a lot of scenes, and that\&#39;s not good considering that I just watch the movie no more then fifteen minutes ago. So what I\&#39;m going to do is list the top five things wrong with this film 1. Usually when horror movie monster have their own theme music, it\&#39;s not heard by the victims or even by the monster itself. So why were just about every person involved in this movie able to here this pathetic whistling. I mean I saw the scarecrows face and nothing about it said that he was the whistling type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Why on earth were there murders on a beach. I\&#39;m sorry, but threw out history beaches are associated with party time and vacation type feelings. But I guess this horror movie thought it was going to be such a success that it would change all of that. Plus was it me or did the beach seem to be the size of someone living room. I mean every time an actor or actress was running around on the beach, it looked as if they were running in the same spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The girl running in the gray sweat pants. That really bother during the duration of this film. I mean she looks so ridiculous. Plus it didn\&#39;t help any that she looked as though she was the youngest out of the whole group. I mean what was she like twelve or something. There no excuse for someone to be that thin on camera. I mean doesn\&#39;t the camera add like ten pounds or something, so what was her excuse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. People trying to get record deals on camera. Just when I thought that this movie could not get any cheesier, out comes the wanna be Gorth Brooks and oh man was he lame. I don\&#39;t\&#39; remember the whole scene, but from what I do remember it was not pretty. This one guy starts singing this song about something that has nothing, and I mean nothing to do with what\&#39;s going on in the film. The funniest part of the whole happening is how everyone seems to being enjoying this. I mean the only person who doesn\&#39;t really know how to response to this is the &#34;token black guy&#34;. And that\&#39;s sad because if I\&#39;m not mistaken he was the one that encourage this latest addition of American Idoal. But here\&#39;s where it gets funny. While this guy is all into his new song or whatever. In the far distance we see or villain aka the scarecrow. And boy does he look pi**ed off at this. I mean there\&#39;s actually a moment where he looks like he\&#39;s really jealous of this guy. So what does he do about this jealousy, well I\&#39;m glad you ask. He wait\&#39;s for the guy to finish his song, and then he finises the guy. I don\&#39;t want to give the death scene away, but I can tell you this. If that scene doesn\&#39;t make you laugh, then nothing on this earth will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. This movie was way longer then I expected. And it didn\&#39;t help that they tried to pulled some pathetic twist bulls**t at the end to squeeze another 10 minutes out of this film. I mean I\&#39;ll admit, I didn\&#39;t see the twist coming, but that had a lot to do with the fact that I was hoping that the film was over and done with. But no they had to do they twist s**t. Needless to say that when I say that coming, I just turned off the T.V. and said f**k it, there\&#39;s no way that movie could have gotten any worser. Thanks to my rather fast judgment I can say that I\&#39;ll never know what was to happen next. But I promise that I do not care!!!!!!!!!!!!! All and all the movie is good for a laugh, but please don\&#39;t buy it. Just hype it up to one of your friends and watch it on there expanse.&#39;
b&#39;(There Are Spoilers) Usual slasher film with the story taking place in and around this God-forsaken mine outside the almost deserted town of Sutterille. After receiving a letter map and gold nugget from her brother Jared, Shadrach Smith, Clair and her husband Nick Breman, Carrie Bradac &amp; Sean Hines, drive to the village together with four other friends and armature gold-prospectors Alx &amp; Tori, Steve Wastell &amp; Sangie, and Hayden &amp; Rox Ann, Rick Majeske &amp; Elina to stake their claim. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It later turns out that the fact that Jared disturbed the long-forgotten gold mine caused the ghost of the notorious Jeremiah Stone, Vernon Wells, to come back to life and with that restart his reign of terror. Stone, or 49er, is about the most ridicules slasher/killer in motion picture history. Stone looks like he was buried for years under a few tons of coal runs around with this hook slicing people in two. After doing in almost the entire cast local hermit Aunt Nelly, (Karen Black), who\&#39;s daughter Eve (Alexandra Ford) was also one of Stone\&#39;s victims, tells those still alive that unless they return the gold back to the Stone mine the crazed miner will never rest until he kills all those who still have it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aunt Nelly is given just enough time to tell her story before she\&#39;s turned into a human torch by Stone and ends up jumping into a nearby stream.The movie goes on endlessly with the killer miner on the rampage looking like he\&#39;s about as scary as burnt toast and just as dark. Even those in the film seemed to show no real fear of him. In one scene when he broke into Aunt Nelly\&#39;s house everyone inside all charged, instead of running away, him causing the ghost miner to lose his right arm; Stone spent the rest of the movie with a miner\&#39;s pick attached to his &#34;stump&#34;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides Actress Karen Black the film &#34;Miners Massacre&#34; also has veteran actors John Phillip Law and Richard Lynch as the town Sheriff Murphy and Old Man Prichard. Passable stuff but nothing special the movie has a predictable ending with the entire gold mine going up in flames. The audience given a hint by the makers of &#34;Miners Massacre&#34; that the end to this mindless lunacy is nowhere in sight and may very well resurface in the very near future in a possible sequel, God help us all!&#39;
b&#34;First I have to say that I have read everything about this subject and I know it inside out, and I was excited about finally seeing it, too. But you have to read only the book this mini-series is based on to realize that it&#39;s not the true story of what really happened almost 90 years ago. It&#39;s loosely based on the facts, the rest is taken from the scriptwriter&#39;s imagination. And unfortunately these changes are anything but successful and mostly totally unnecessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where do I begin? Vita and Violet didn&#39;t use the names Mitya and Lushka until their affair started, and during it Violet also called Vita Dmitri and Julian. It was Violet who chased Vita with a dagger when they were teenagers. The &#39;seduction&#39; scene when their affair started Violet was much more passive than represented here and certainly didn&#39;t kiss Vita first. I could go on and on, these examples were all included when the series was only just started. Besides all these alterations from the facts, the characterizations are also all wrong. At times Vita behaves like a mad woman. Especially the scene where she saw from the newspaper Violet&#39;s engagement announcement is just ridiculous. Vita kept her surges of emotion inside. It was Violet who was temperamental and let her feelings (good or bad) show. All Vita did when she read it was that she nearly fainted, that&#39;s all. Being a gentle nature, Harold avoided confrontations in real life, but here he is sometimes pretty stern and accusing. Harold and Vita always discussed their intimate things in letters, not verbally. And Violet... I know that this series purposely concentrated on Vita and Harold, but that doesn&#39;t mean that all the other characters have to be mere puppets on the sidelines. Here she is totally one-dimensional character, and the lines gave to her are mostly embarrassingly shallow. Actually she was intelligent, gifted, quite an extraordinary woman who has rarely given the credit she deserves. I have always thought her much more interesting person than Vita. In this series her unhappiness, loneliness and her problems with her mother are totally ignored. Viewer has also little clue of her background and family, what kind of relation (and marriage) with Denys Trefusis she had or how hard she battled over Vita. Vita was the only love of her life, her raison d&#39;etre, and if Harold suffered during affair, so did Violet. After it her life was in ruins, and it took time that she could pull herself back together again. Statue could have acted the role of Denys, that much depth his character has. Lady Sackville-West is just a badly drawn caricature; an annoying chatterbox with exaggerating french accent. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The series ends to the totally badly written scene in Amiens, and that was the end of this affair, according to scriptwriter. No, it continued a whole year after that, and it&#39;s ending was much more lingering and sad than what was presented here. But what one cares about the stupid ending if the whole series has been stupid from the start. I have to give some credit to actors, they tried to make best of those roles given to them though Janet McTeer as Vita is the only one who really shines through. One can&#39;t complain the settings either. All complaints go to director and most of all, scriptwriter. Instead of insightful character studies, there are too many sex scenes and bland conversation. Many of the scenes are too long, some are pointless and don&#39;t bring anything to the story line. On the other hand many details are shortened or omitted altogether. Especially there should have been more information about Vita&#39;s and Violet&#39;s youth, and how their friendship developed. This is one fascinating story which would have deserved a much better adaptation. Maybe someday someone will do it. At the moment one can make much more of this story by reading the actual book or Violet&#39;s letters to Vita, which are brilliant stuff.&#34;
b&#34;This movie just didn&#39;t do it for me. I like horror and splatter movies but this one has very little to do with horror. The effects are cheap and when they chop of one of her feet it looks so fake. The same goes for the other effects like the tongue torture and the gut sex. They could have spent of few extra bucks on the effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With lots of sex (with pixelization as in all Japanese movies) this is just a sick fetish porn and there seems to be a market for sick stuff like this. While bloodier, for me it fits in with titles like Squirmfest / Purge and the Genki series. These movies feature girls eating and playing with every fluid that comes out of your body, eating bugs and fish in a gross way and having sex with all kinds of weird animals, like toads, eels and... One look at the covers will tell horror fans to look elsewhere. No horror here,just sick and degrading sex scenes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Horror fans should avoid this one and are better of checking out Guinea Pig2: Flowers of Flesh and Blood or even August Underground Mordum. While these are not great they at least offer a horror experience and Niku Daruma absolutely fails in that department.&#34;
b&#39;From the brilliant mind that brought us &#34;The Exorcist&#34;...and &#34;Cruising.&#34; &#34;Rampage&#34; is unfortunately more like the latter. It\&#39;s an overall messy movie that has a major made-for-TV vibe going for it. The whole film pretends to hinge on the question, &#34;What if the \&#39;Boy Next Door\&#39; was a serial killer?&#34; but instead it winds up being an uninspired courtroom drama and meditation on the the insanity plea and death penalty that makes little sense. The movie is very loosely based on the Richard Trenton Chase case, culling a few facts here and there to make a fake character and a different outcome. One of the main points of the film seems to be that ending the life of a terminally braindead child and ending the life of a murderer are somehow analagous. &#34;Sometimes you just have to choose,&#34; says the lead character. Yeah, sometimes you have to choose to pull the plug...on your TV!&#39;
b&#34;I can not believe the positive reaction to this movie. I had great expectations for it and was disappointed. First of all, they used every cheesy racism clich\xc3\xa9 in the book. It was so predictable. For instance, from the second the young Latino guy showed up you just knew that he would be a really nice guy because he looked like a gangbanger. Matt Dillon&#39;s character has been played a million times, a cop who had been hardened over the years and would see the light to some degree by the end of the movie. The predictability hardly ended with those characters. A phenomenal cast was wasted on a weak script. The morals of the story were PC to the max. There were a few clever twists but not nearly enough. The dialouge was embarrassing at times. It wasn&#39;t all bad.I just can&#39;t believe this movies high score so far. It was somewhat entertaining, just a little insulting to ones intelligence. I admire what this movie was trying to achieve but it fell well short.&#34;
b&#39;It is a movie which sheds the light on the begging of the Palestinian struggle against the Israeli occupation of Palestine but it does not show the real feelings of the people back then and how they were tricked into believing that they could return to their home soon , it does not mention the massacres committed by the Jews like Der Yassine and how they tortured and killed and destroyed the family of any Palestinian freedom fighter it lacks the credibility about the real Palestinian struggle and about anything Palestinian , however it has something about the suffering of Palestinian citizens ending up as refugees in the nearby Arab countries , the movie focuses on the story of the man in coma he is now in the present time and through his story we see the film . The movie is just telling the life of one person and has some nudity scenes which are irrelevant to the story.&#39;
b&#39;I was looking forward to watching this movie, and it does contain very interesting perspectives from Iraqis all over the country, not just in major areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, as the film went on, and as it seemed to become increasingly more one-sided, I started wondering who had edited the film. To get several hundreds of hours down to just 80 minutes, obviously decisions had to be made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have really enjoyed a film that showed how everyday Iraqis felt on all sides of the issues, but with the newspaper headlines in contrast to what people were saying, and with everyone in the movie having the same opinion at the end, I thought it was obvious that the editing was done with a pre-conceived bias.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It could have been such a great film.&#39;
b&#39;I attempted to watch this, and was highly disappointed. Don\&#39;t expect intelligent and insightful humor ala Amy\&#39;s brother David amidst this dreck... it is the polar opposite. But if you\&#39;re into poop, fart and boner jokes, you\&#39;ll be in seventh heaven. This is bathroom humor aimed, I assume, at those who\&#39;ve had several bongs, which can only explain why many ecstatic reviewers have heralded this crap as &#34;the best television writing ever.&#34; I assume that those who hate such simpleton humor were unable to watch long enough to care to submit a review, but I am just sending out a warning shot to those unaware viewers who are looking for high-end comedy. The characters overact. The shock factor is set to 10. And the laughs are set to zero (unless, of course, you seek juvenile, low-brow humor.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made it through 40 minutes, praying the whole time it would turn the corner toward worthwhile entertainment, but alas, it just got worse and worse. And beware of Amy\&#39;s ever-present and hammy overbite expression - it will set your eyes rolling. It was nice to see cameos by recognizable comedic actors I enjoy, but I can only assume they agreed to participate as a favor to the Sedaris family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To those who loved it, I\&#39;m sorry... this is my opinion. It was so bad it inspired me to write my first review.&#39;
b&#39;Has this ever happened to you? I go into my local video store and see a few new arrivals in the &#34;film noir&#34; section. I spy a copy of a new arrival of a film I have never seen called NAKED ALIBI. Its from one of those mail order video companies that offers (mostly) &#34;dupey&#34; looking copies of hard to find titles. The description on the box sounds good. The film has players I like (Sterling Hayden, Gloria Grahame, and Gene Barry). So I take it home and watch it. About ten minutes into this film I started having second thoughts. About half way through this film I started to dislike it. By the time the film ended, I not only disliked it, I despised it. The film opens with cops questioning Al Willis on suspicion of robbery. Other than being drunk, the police have nothing on him. When he pushes a cop and demands to be allowed to go home, the cops beat him up. Detective Conroy arrives, lets the cops finish the beating and then announces Willis is in the clear. Willis swears he will get revenge. Later one of the police officers is shot dead. With no evidence other that Willis is &#34;sore&#34; about the beating, Conroy make Willis his sole suspect, despite the fact that his boss names a pair of mobsters as suspects. Conroy arrests him, but for lack evidence Willis is released. The next day two more cops are killed by a bomb. This time Conroy goes to the Bakery that Willis owns and tries to beat a confession out of him. Conroy doesn\&#39;t know it but a local newsman whose paper has been accusing Conroys department of police brutality snaps a picture of Conroy trying strangle Willis and Conroy is fired. But Conroy continues his pursuit and Willis flees to Mexico where Willis has a mistress. Conroy manages to convince his mistress (who Willis treats rather rough) to help him prove Willis is a killer. What this film lacks is a convincing script. The script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed. Things happen, characters personalities change, plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it. Other than the fact that Willis likes to tip a glass now and than, there is nothing in the early part of the film to make us think that he is a crazy killer that cheats on his wife. He treats his wife, his kid and employees well. Early in the film, one gets the impression that its Conroy is the one whose is a loose cannon. He seems to casually approve of police brutality. Conroy, for no reason is convinced from the very start Willis has criminal past. He seems to operate on the motto of the old Communist Bulgarian secret police; &#34;Everyone is guilty of something, we just have not found out about it yet.&#34; Later Conroy shows kindness to Al\&#39;s mistress and young son, now we are supposed to like him. Sorry! The early impression I got of Conroy stuck with me too long. And he is also a dumb cop. Only after he is fired and goes to Mexico does he run a background check on Willis and discovers that a warrant is out for him issued in Maryland. Why didn\&#39;t he think of this before? Because this film hadn\&#39;t used up enough running time. The cast is good. Gene Barry does well considering how poorly conceived his role of Al Willis is. I\&#39;m big fan of 40\&#39;s and 50\&#39;s crime thrillers but not only did I not think this film was good, it left a bad taste in my mouth (something many modern films do, but older films rarely do).&#39;
b&#39;Why does C Thomas Howell do these movies? Cruise (Howell\&#39;s one time co-star) does a huge blockbuster of WOTW and Howell follows with this lame effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where do I start here? Production Values - I\&#39;ll start with the good stuff. The look and feel of some of the scenes in this movie are not too bad to be honest. The set-ups are okay in spots and the direction not too bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Script - Terrible. A series of clunky scenes that could have been put in any order you like permeate throughout the movie. The amount of times the scene faded to black and reemerged a second later in the same room was uncountable. Very poor storyline (but so was the Cruise WOTW) takes some blame but an abysmal screenplay kills it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Special FX - Okay, I don\&#39;t want to be too harsh here as I imagine the budget was smaller than Cruise\&#39;s lunch bill - but in the overall context of the film the effects are badly done. Some shots are quite impressive - mainly far off destruction shots of bridges, Washington, liner. But in the main the &#34;alien&#34; machines and tentacles themselves are dreadful. Also the camera quality is fuzzy on some shots and cuts away entirely on others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acting - I\&#39;m a fan of Howell but as he has reduced himself to acting in these low-budget flicks - he has succumbed to the &#34;over-acting&#34; bug a long time ago. Look at his performance in The Hitcher and compare it to this movie. There is no comparison. He overdoes his facial expressions, his flailing arms and legs (where did he get that running style???) and for a final coup-de-gras look at the scene where he loses the photo of his family. Hysterical. But after saying all that - he is still the best actor on show here. Busey is embarrassing to look at and Peter Green (Zed is truly dead now baby) mumbles incoherently through his one and only scene. I honestly could not understand one word he said - I even went so far as trying to enable the subtitles on that scene - but the DVD did not have subtitles. This seems to be a real keep-it-in-the-family affair too as Howell\&#39;s son, the director\&#39;s wife and the line producer all make it into the film. None of them are good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Direction - not bad but not good either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Score - Dismal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a lame duck effort that will do nothing for Howell in his attempt to make it back to the big time. He should take a look at Rourke and try to figure out how he made in back to the A list but if he keeps doing stuff like this, he won\&#39;t have a career soon enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/10.&#39;
b&#39;I have never really been interested in cannibal movies before and up until a couple of months ago i had avoided this genre of movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently had to undergo knee surgery and found i had a lot of time on my hands as i was unable to work, so i decided after seeing almost every horror movie our local video shop had to offer i would take a chance on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Christ was it a mistake! I have never seen a movie this bad in all my years of being a movie addict. This is just a pile of s**t pasted to a D.V.D disc and sold as a horror movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a lot of respect to other horror fans who can switch their brains off long enough to enjoy this crap, They are more brain dead than i ever will be and that is some achievement! 0/10 and thats generous.&#39;
b&#39;They did it again: ripped off an old show\&#39;s title, then destroyed the nostalgia with boring &#34;re-imagined&#34; stuff. The \&#39;60\&#39;s cartoon was one of the funniest of its time, a good-natured satire of super hero comic books. The character was drawn as 1/2 way between animal and human, the way Mickey Mouse is. Here they use a real beagle; that\&#39;s about the same as making a Mickey Mouse watch with a real rat. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the clever schtick that made the original show funny is missing from this film. Instead, we get a clumsy ex-police dog who\&#39;s even dumber than Cad. And some pet owners who add nothing to the story. Cheesy effects (the dog-talking animation is embarrassing). Poor scripting. A stereotyped dwarf playing Simon Bar Sinister. The gravelly noise box guy they hired to voice Underdog is painful. You\&#39;d think they\&#39;d at least gotten a voice impressionist to approximate Wally Cox\&#39;s humorously distinctive voice for Underdog. But no. There are, at least, a few affectionate references to the source material (such as the rhyming lines), which lift it to a 4. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only small children that love dogs may enjoy this. Everybody else should get a DVD of the original cartoon series. Watch this only in desperation.&#39;
b&#34;Supposedly, a movie about a magazine sending journalists to investigate reports of UFOs with one being more or less tolerant or agnostic about the whole affair and the other an Aussie, a hardened skeptic who laughs at the UFO nonsense. It&#39;s all a crock, some kind of money making racket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turns out this movie is actually a deceit, and a trap to actually promulgate Christian teachings and the Christian explanation of UFOs, one I&#39;ve heard before. This is an ad hoc explanation that is itself not at all biblical but invented by certain modern theologians who can fit anything and everything into their mythology. The paranormal? It&#39;s real, just demonic, unless it takes place in a Christian context, then of course, it is of God. Simple, if it isn&#39;t of God, it&#39;s the of the Devil, stupid! So I suppose since Beethoven&#39;s 9th symphony wasn&#39;t inspired by God, it must have been written under demonic influence. Or so would the logic lead ad absurdum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are informed that since the Bible does not tell of life on other planets in the Universe, therefore there is none (a version of the Ad Ignorantium fallacy) and that God created the Universe so huge, so grand to show us his almighty power. I think of Carl Sagan&#39;s remark that if God created such a huge Universe and stuck life only on Earth it&#39;d have been a tremendous waste of space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what are UFOs? They are Demonic activity and concern the soon to be earthshaking Christian event, the rupture...I mean Rapture. Before the tribulation, the true Christians will disappear from the face of the earth en masse causing mass panic, confusion, car and plane crashes...whatever. Therefore Satan knowing this is sending his demons to basically create an illusion of alien spacecraft and alien abduction which can then be used to explain away this otherwise inexplicable event. All part of Satan&#39;s plan which will of course keep people from looking to God or Jesus and fall for the lies of the AntiChrist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This ad hoc explanation also typifies theological mishmash by explaining away one mystery with another, in opposition to the scientific method of explaining the unknown, the strange, and the mysterious in as much as possible, first by the known, if not solely by the known.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s like jumping straight to an alien abduction whenever a child is missing and unaccounted for. I think I&#39;d look first at more mundane explanations like the child has run away, gotten lost, or been kidnapped for ransom or abducted by a predatory pedophile before invoking aliens, or the supernatural or Satan or some such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kind of deceit or trap on the part of fundamentalists is nothing new, as young people are often lured to Free Rock Concerts, that may start out with something innocuous then suddenly switch to overt Christian music, followed by a sermon and an altar call. This kind of blatant deception one might think would be more Satan&#39;s ballgame. But maybe because the Christian faith is soon to be in its death throes, these guys feel that anything goes, any deception or trickery or scare tactics are acceptable to try to keep the faith alive, which is facing serious opposition from both secularists as well as competing faiths like Islam, the world&#39;s fastest growing religion which may well replace Christianity, as Islam is far more cohesive and unified, and logically more tenable than Christian fundamentalism. Although this should offer little advantage to mankind, as it would be replacing one intolerant thought system with another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And of course the movie ends more or less with a variant of Pascal&#39;s wager. The atheistic Aussie who is skeptical about just about everything is told. Well, if you are right about there being no afterlife and death is nothing but rotting in the grave, no worry...but what if you&#39;re wrong?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, statements implying that reality is going to conform to nothing but an atheistic viewpoint or Christian fantasy, is a false dilemma or Black and White fallacy. Even if the atheists are wrong would not necessarily make Christianity correct by default, nor if Christianity turns out to be full of holes in its theology, that the materialistic atheists are therefore correct by default.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For all we know, Native American spirituality might turn out to be the best description of ultimate reality and we might all of use have wished we treated the Earth and its creatures a wee bit better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie should be stamped right on the box: Caution: Contains religious Propaganda and not meant for informative or entertainment purposes.&#34;

b&#39;Korea\&#39;s answer to &#34;I Know What You Did Last Summer&#34; follows a similar story route to its American counterpart: one year after a group of high school friends accidentally kill a classmate, a masked killer begins to pick them off one by one. Who could have possibly seen them that night - or was their \&#39;victim\&#39; still alive when they dumped him into the sea?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Originality cannot be expected from the teen slasher genre anymore but an effort can still be made to ensure films of this ilke are entertaining and scary. RECORD is neither, churning out badly rehashed scenes from &#34;I Know...&#34;, &#34;The House On Sorority Row&#34; and &#34;The Faculty&#34; (among many others) and failing to deliver one decent shock throughout the 95 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acting is decent from the cast who, as seems to be the norm in Korean cinema, approach an uninspiring script with gusto and an undeserved enthusiasm. Direction is mediocre at best, however; a strange choice of camera angles and the worst killer\&#39;s costume *EVER* contributing to RECORD\&#39;s downfall. Most disappointing is the film\&#39;s ending, where the two \&#39;surprise twists\&#39; are that obvious you\&#39;ve earlier dismissed them as being too blatant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RECORD\&#39;s only saving grace is its bright start - the first act is actually excellent and shows the American counterparts how character development and setting the mood are supposed to be done - but, other than that, this is a very poor movie. Not recommended. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** / *****&#39;
b&#34;This film had all the ingredients of a good adventure movie, but it revealed incompetence at almost every level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The presence of Roger Moore in the cast list is usually a sign that the movie is not going to be anything more than mediocre, because Moore always has lead roles and he can&#39;t act. But this movie also had Ian Holm and Lee Marvin in it, and was based on a Wilbur smith book, so I thought I&#39;d give it a chance when I saw the DVD for sale in the bargain bin...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a mistake. The opening scene appeared to start in the middle of a reel, with sound suddenly appearing as if the first second of the soundtrack had been truncated. The scene showed a dreadnought at sea with a German crew. This bad editing was a sign of things to come, but the scene with the dreadnought was interesting enough to keep me watching. The special effects were good, and the crew wore the proper uniforms and spoke in German, indicating that the director at least paid attention to historical detail. I was surprised. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I kept watching, and then Moore appeared and my supicions were confirmed. Bad acting, clich\xc3\xa9d lines, clich\xc3\xa9d cinematography and cheap humour...but worst of all, there is a disastrous attempt to blend the light-hearted feel of the film with serious drama and tragedy. It just does not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film ends as suddenly and as badly as it started \xc2\x96 in the middle of a reel.&#34;
b&#34;This in-name-only sequel to the classic ROADHOUSE has a DEA agent (John Schaech) coming to the rescue of his uncle (Will Patton) when the uncle is badly beaten up by a local drug gang, headed by that Wooden Indian of an actor Jake Busey. The gang wants to take over the poor guy&#39;s bar for nefarious reasons. Patrick Swayze is sorely missed here. Schaech is an indifferent actor and not convincing as an ass-kicking lawman. The fights here are intermittent and not nearly as powerful or vicious as the fights in ROADHOUSE. The finale is equally weak. Some good-looking women keep things afloat for a bit. There is a terrific fight between a Daisy Duke-type who turns out to be handy with both fists and weapons, and a nasty-looking babe of Busey&#39;s who is handy with sharp implements. There&#39;s also a scantily dressed gal at the beginning who is a fellow agent of Schaech&#39;s, but unfortunately she never reappears in the film. Too bad. She does a brief lap dance for Schaech that had my full attention. If nothing else, ROADHOUSE 2 kicks off with a strip club scene that comes darned close to what a real strip club looks like, a rare circumstance in any movie. The rest is snooze time.&#34;
b&#39;Obviously, this one doesn\&#39;t aim for the brain : the so-called &#34;humour&#34; is based on farting and every clich\xc3\xa9 about any ethnic genre you can imagine, gays included of course, as long as they are not WASP. And a latino cowrote this ? Besides, John Leguizamo does have talent and charisma, but in such a self-indulgent movie it is a definite waste. What the point in trying to out-Jim Carrey Jim Carrey himself ? &#34;The Pest&#34; of the title could then be this movie, almost as funny as Bergman\&#39;s finest. Prepare to be annoyed, not amused&#39;
b&#39;Simply put, I was amazingly disappointed. I\&#39;m a huge fan of Asian Horror, and I can watch unoriginality (I myself enjoyed &#34;The Red Shoes&#34; and &#34;Phone&#34;), but this was just poor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie has a lot of elements that are very high-quality: the photography is eye-catching, the visuals are cool, the directing is inspired, the acting is pretty good, the music is easy on the ears, and the CGI is incredible. But, since this is a horror film, we are expected to be scared, which just won\&#39;t happen with this film. As with most South Korean horrors, this is unoriginal almost from beginning to end: there\&#39;s the trademark long-haired vengeful female ghost, ominous clumps of thick, black hair and puddles of water, and near the end, a twist that *almost*, but not quite makes sense out of the whole thing (the twist is easily one of the best qualities). And to the viewer\&#39;s irritation, when the film isn\&#39;t recycling (at times, so exact that it could easily be dubbed plagiarized) imagery from other movies, it\&#39;s making you jump. A lot. And by jumps, I don\&#39;t mean things jumping out or anything, just VERY loud noises and screeches in the soundtrack used to make the audience jump six feet in the air (there\&#39;s even a few &#34;made-you-jump&#34; moments that are simply infuriating). And when it is not ripping-off other movies, it\&#39;s boring, and hard to sit through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it\&#39;s a shame, because &#34;Ryeong&#34; could have easily been really good, and it has everything to make it good, but its the annoying overuse of completely predictable loud noises and jump scares that eventually ruin the movie. A perfect example of how good it could have been: there\&#39;s a moment when one of out characters is looking at a corpse, and without a sound, the corpse looks back. It\&#39;s wholly predictable, but the use of silence in that scene is brilliant. And unfortunately, that\&#39;s as scary as the movie got for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Admittedly, &#34;Ryeong&#34; has a few good features, and even a couple jumps that aren\&#39;t as predictable, and do work. There\&#39;s a very good and sad back-story used to explain the events, and the twist is pretty unpredictable. Those are the only things that separate the film from any other Asian ghost/horror film. But the problem with these is, even though they do work, they have been used before (J-Horror fans will easily realize the big reveal was inspired by &#34;A Tale of Two Sisters&#34;), and it takes the back-story a good fifty minutes to get going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in the end, &#34;Ryong&#34; really seems like a truly wasted opportunity. Tae-kyeong Kim hoped that the plot twist and other good features act as diversions, so the audience won\&#39;t notice the huge flaws. But he failed, and well... We noticed everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My rating: 4/10.&#39;
b&#34;Okay... she&#39;s on the boat with this guy, realizes he&#39;s out to kill her, knocks him out, and then finds the reason he&#39;s out to off her is this disk that got her coworker killed. So what would any rational person do? Maybe conk him over the head again to make sure he&#39;s really out?? Tie him up?? Look, Sandra honey, you&#39;ve got the chance to escape while the guy is out for only so long. Until you know how long it will take you take you to escape, make sure he&#39;s not able to come after you. I HATE these stupid female victim roles. The rest of the movie was just a series of twists and turns that were completely convoluted and too unbelievable to remain interesting.&#34;
b&#39;The series finally hits rock-bottom with this lousy fourth installment, which was (thank God) the last one. None of the three sequels did justice to the highly entertaining original, but this particular film is nothing more than a shameless attempt to exploit the name of the &#34;Magnificent Seven&#34; and Bernstein\&#39;s rousing music theme. The production values resemble those of a made-for-TV movie and the characters are forgettable and indistinguishable: in parts &#34;II&#34; and &#34;III&#34; you couldn\&#39;t remember their names, here you can\&#39;t even remember their faces. Lee Van Cleef was an inappropriate choice for the role of Chris, but nobody could have replaced Yul Brynner in our minds anyway. Don\&#39;t waste your time.&#39;
b&#34;This is the first Woody Allen film I&#39;ve found not worth watching. I think Woody has tried many different genres to interest results but this movie just left me irritated and bored. The music is lovely but don&#39;t bother watching this hopeless mock-umentary.&#34;
b&#39;Stay away from this movie. Far away. Phil Fondacaro stars as the demented ringleader of a Freakshow. Every performance is flat and unfeeling, except Fondacaro\&#39;s. The plot is a simple one, and follows almost every horror movie cliche possible. A group of high-school kids go to a carnival, see a side-show, and get in over their heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fans of Fred Olen Ray should be warned, this is not like any of his other films. This one is lacking in all departments (humor, sex, horror, etc.) other F.O. Ray movies excell in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The version I saw also contained a Making-Of documentry, in which the director makes comments like &#34;We had a limited budget&#34; and &#34;with our limited timeline&#34; which speaks volumes about how much Charles Band cared about this film. Go rent &#34;Droid Runner&#34; (Fred Olen Ray) or &#34;The Dead Hate the Living&#34; (Full Moon) instead. Full Moon should be ashamed of themselves (and that\&#39;s saying a lot after seeing &#34;Killer Eye&#34;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grade: D-&#39;
b&#39;Okay they tell you it\&#39;s real. They don\&#39;t list any screenwriters or directors, but one viewing of this movie will prove to anyone - It\&#39;s not real in the way you were hoping for. The speaking rarely sounds like real natural talk...but also down not sound to be scripted. (possibly loosely scripted). To me it sounded much more like they were always trying to ad-lib. (which they almost always did poorly). Therefore, they knew they were making a \&#39;movie\&#39;, not just collecting real natural footage. So I\&#39;m sure these people knew what was going on, knew they had certain spots to look for things that were set up...and they were just told to ad-lib around it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*************\&#39;Major Spoilers\&#39;**************** *****************************************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, it\&#39;s so lame. Every item, spot or thing that could be strange or use d as a scare, is magically stumbled upon by these people. Let me list off the ridiculously obviously faked things that happened that I remember:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Less than 2 minutes of entering the house, they turn a light switch on - the light sparks and a chandelier almost falls on a guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) They happen to find an old medical bag with a bloody butcher knife* in it, while exploring the cellar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) They hear a noise in an armoire, so they open the door slowly - BAM - a cat happens to be in there and jumps straight at the camera while shrieking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Then they happen to notice there is a hole in the wall, so let\&#39;s stick our hand in...wow, they pulled out a doll of a baby wrapped in mummy tape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) Let\&#39;s go to the attic, uh-oh it feels \&#39;heavy\&#39; up here....BOOM - a chair flies across the room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6) Time to eat. Oh no ! The girl that was scared of bugs had a ROACH in her sandwich ! LOL !....ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7) Let\&#39;s get out the Ouija board...oops one of the legs on the planchette fell off the side of the board. That couldn\&#39;t be because the people were pushing it could it ? (they find out a ghost there is named Charles)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8) Wait ! What was that noise in the chimney...CLINK - oh my shackles fell out &#34;I think she* kept people up here&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9) Now wimpy girl is going to brave looking up the chimney shaft...oh, what\&#39;s this she sees something...and is asking people who aren\&#39;t looking up the chimney what it is. SWISH - It falls off straight at her. (perfect camera shot) She moves just in time. It was more chain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10) Now we have to separate and each \&#39;cleanse\&#39; our designated rooms - wouldn\&#39;t it be something if things started happening one by one to these people now...okay:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CHICK #1: Wow, suddenly her room is shaking...but no one elses does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DUDE #1: Actually says to himself &#34;Charles, is that you Charles...it can\&#39;t be you because you\&#39;re just a figment of my imagination aren\&#39;t you Charles&#34;. Well guess what, he gets knocked over and dragged across the floor. Another lucky camera shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CHICK #2: Hears things..try to communicate ...and is standing there getting abrasions or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DUDE #2: He was in the attic, reached his arm through a hole in the floor and got a splinter....I don\&#39;t remember what else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11) Dude #2 runs, gets Chick #2...they hear chick and dude #1 screaming...they find them chained to a wall and strapped to a table.(*) They leave. Cut to black. Final text tell us they escaped safely, were treated for minor cuts. They have since had nightmares and insomnia, we also find out the next day a 911 call was made by they name a someone named &#34;Charles&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*************\&#39;Major Spoilers\&#39;**************** ******************over********************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, when I first heard this movie was being made, I couldn\&#39;t wait. I thought it was going to be real. REAL, real. - and more professional, with more professional type people. I love the idea of this type of thing, I\&#39;d love to see real haunting footage. Before this movie was released I saw couple reviews of it by people online. They both claimed how fake it was and how stupid the people were.. time passed I forgot about the film....then I realized It was never released at theaters. So I found out it went straight to video, rented it....found that every brutal review was completely true. It\&#39;s too bad, I really wanted this to be good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Random thought: The house didn\&#39;t seem to have TVs, radios..kitchen appliances that I recall...which would make me think no one has lived there for a long time. Especially the house is truly known for being haunted...im pretty sure no one lives there. But it looks so clean and tidy...and what was a cat doing there ? The property does not have near by neighbors....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, you\&#39;ll only want to rent this if you and your friends wanna sit there and make fun of it...or if you heard about it a long time ago and it intrigued you. (you will will be disappointed if you are expecting a good film...or real film)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Random thought: I believe the producer says &#34;The \&#39;footage\&#39; you see is real&#34;. Well technically it is real footage isn\&#39;t it ? Real footage of fake hauntings ? Maybe that was his loop hole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this this movie one star - strictly on the fact that they told the story of Madame LaLaurie. A real New Orleans story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best performance was by the guy who teaches the participants about the ghost hunting equipment in the beginning. He was obviously actually real...or a good actor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;
b&#39;What a sucky movie. This is without a doubt a low-class B movie. The German elite StormTroopers assault Russian bunkers en masse like an old WW1 battle. The acting is mediocre, the plot thin and threadlike. It\&#39;s hard sometimes to follow where it\&#39;s going. The action sequences are pretty worthless (when it shows any), except for the fact that they do use authentic equipment/vehicles from WW2. This is in NO WAY on the same level as &#34;Saving Pvt. Ryan&#34; or &#34;Platoon&#34;. Lots of worthless attempts at character development, which lead nowhere. Old theme good officer/bad officer that\&#39;s highly predictable. Even the action sequences look like a 12yr old kid set them up. I could have directed better. Too bad this is the same guy that did &#34;Das Boot (The Boat)&#34;, because that was a dang good movie. He must have partied too much after that success because he sure lost his touch when it came to this film. I bought it on DVD, better to rent it instead.&#39;
b&#39;I\&#39;ve already commented on this film (under the name TheLegendaryWD). But I see there are others who have commented since. All I can say is: WHAT THE F**K!?&#34;. I cannot believe that a whole 16 people have commented on this film or even seen this movie. Add to that the fact that a couple give it great reviews (probably the makers of the film who went to one of those places in a strip mall that provide internet service and wrote a good review - seeing as how there is no way they could or would pay for their own internet provider... just look at their movie). Although I still admit I got a soft spot for this movie. I thought that some of the other people writing about this one might have it confused with another... until I read the reviews... especially the person who identified the tag line on the front of the box: &#34;The Ultimate in Frontal Lobotomy&#34; (what the f**k is that supposed to mean anyway? &#34;frontal&#34; lobotomy?)... I totally forgot about that until I read it in the review. People, we are a select few... I say we meet once a year to view this film... wait, does anyone still have it? If anyone does have it please contact me... I\&#39;m dyin\&#39; to get drunk.&#39;
b&#34;What starts off fairly well (and quite disturbing) quickly sinks into an annoying mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dee Snider (of Twisted Sister infamy) apparently penned the screenplay from his own idea, and while the idea of a cyber-stalking pierce freak has potential, they really blow it here on uneven pacing, bad dialogue, and one of the greatest non-endings you&#39;ll ever see. Despite some lifeless performances, the director manages a genuinely creepy first reel. This really looks like it&#39;s going to be a good low-budget effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No such luck. The plot goes all over the map, and Snider&#39;s character relentlessly spits out tiresome psychotic fortune cookie lines that are supposed to pass for meaningful dialogue. Worse, the supporting cast barely registers, and the only halfway believable dialogue comes from a young girl who helps a detective navigate the internet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a waste of a great idea. Oh, and there is a new twisted Sister song, if you care.&#34;
b&#39;Mind-numbingly boring, utterly predictable and in the end simply laughable. That pretty much sums up the disaster that is Indecent Proposal. Starting with a decent premise the whole thing just unravels and becomes a complete mess. Basically the story boils down to the question, &#34;would you let your wife sleep with another man for one million dollars?&#34; Here of course the answer is yes because otherwise we wouldn\&#39;t have a movie. Quite frankly, we\&#39;d have been better off if we didn\&#39;t have a movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our married (and financially troubled) couple are played by Woody Harrelson and Demi Moore. They go to Vegas to get rich. Yeah, that\&#39;ll work. Anyhow, a billionaire, played by Robert Redford, takes a liking to the wife and makes the million dollar offer. For one night with the wife he will give them financial security. The aftermath of that one night is what the movie is really all about. Unfortunately nothing in that aftermath is the least bit entertaining. The script is so predictable you can say the characters\&#39; lines before they do. The performances leave much to be desired. Harrelson would be better off sticking to comedies as this attempt at serious acting completely misses the mark. Anguish is not something he seems capable of portraying. And it is quite safe to say that Demi Moore will never have to clear space in her home for any Academy Awards. Why is she a movie star again? In a part that should be full of emotion she conveys none. Only Redford escapes mostly unscathed. He\&#39;s appropriately slimy yet suave and clearly the best actor of the bunch. But he can\&#39;t save this film. Awful script, lousy acting, plodding pace, zero entertainment...Indecent Proposal is downright awful.&#39;
b&#39;This one was truly awful. Watching with fascinated horror, I kept on asking &#34;why have they done this?&#34; That is, taken all the scenarios out of &#34;The Day after Tomorrow&#34;, &#34;The Perfect Storm&#34; and &#34;Twister&#34; and remixing them in a three-hour miniseries, directed by long-time junk TV director Dick Lowry, with every disaster movie clich\xc3\xa9 known to man and not an ounce of real suspense. Many of the cast were unknown Canadians and location filming was done in Canada, Winnepeg doubling for Chicago, so no doubt tax breaks had something to do with it. Although some ambitious special effects were attempted, the execution is so poor no decent spectacle is achieved. The actors may be a competent lot; the script is so bad no-one had a chance to show it, except perhaps for Randy Quaid as Tommy the Tornado chaser, who went right over the top and was quite amusing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Believe it or not, the producers have since made another one of these Canadian disaster turkeys called &#34;Category 7 \xc2\x96 the End of the World&#34; which was very tastefully shown on CBS in the US a few weeks after Hurricane Katrina. How could the network of Ed Murrow and Walter Cronkite do such a thing? In prime time? PT Barnum &#34;nobody ever went broke underestimating public taste&#34; is proved right once more.&#39;
b&#34;This movie was really bad. First they didn&#39;t even follow the facts for it. Half of the movie was made up and it was more about the deputy whose mother was one of Ed Gein&#39;s victims. The acting was horrible, except for the guy playing Ed Gein, but its not hard to mess up playing a weird guy. though i think it was horrible i gave it a three because they started it off with actual crime photos. that was the best part of the movie. As soon as the introduction of the movie was finished the movie went downhill. The writer of this movie tried to spice it up, but it didn&#39;t need to be. The story of Ed Gein is interesting enough without falsifying information.&#34;
b&#39;This woman is a terrible comedian. She can\&#39;t crack a joke. She has no real character. This is another example of typical American rubbish, that people laugh at, because they have no idea how to react, so they say to themselves, &#34;well, it\&#39;s a comedy show,&#34; so I\&#39;ll laugh, I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot stand this miserable woman, and her pi$$ poor excuse for comedy. She does not deserve anything but booing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why can\&#39;t America dump this kind of turdish delight, and go for something that actually contains humour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She is not funny. Not at all. Why oh why does even ONE person like this idiot?&#39;
b&#34;When a friend once lambasted me for my first movie (a pretty bad videotaped affair), I argued that I could grow; Orson Welles&#39; first movie, indeed, was even worse. He challenged me that it couldn&#39;t be, so I pulled out the Criterion laserdisc of (I think) CITIZEN KANE and played HEARTS OF AGE. My friend lasted just a few minutes before conceding the point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a little humor in this short, but it&#39;s basically as pretentious as (and perhaps a collegiate answer to) BLOOD OF A POET and other avant garde films of the time. It is what it is: a succession of images with a vague theme, and unless you really enjoy any footage of Welles (in heavy makeup, to boot), this isn&#39;t really even worth tracking down.&#34;
b&#39;first off, i\&#39;m amazed to see that this film has got a rating of 7 on this site. at first i thought it might be industry people logging in to IMDb and jacking up the rating. but after looking on rotten tomatoes and seeing that this film has something like a 76% approval rating, it seems that maybe folks have just been duped again into mistaking pretentious crap for profundity. i mean, this film is simply awful. the acting is simply terrible, but the rest of the film is worse. at least the acting provides some (unintentional) laughs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the plot involves a teenage skateboarding boy who is being questioned along with his friends for a murder that happened by a park where they skate. and that\&#39;s about it. the rest of the film consists of the aforementioned terrible acting, terrible dialog, slow motion shots of people walking, of people\&#39;s faces, of people skating, often set to music that does not fit the scene. perhaps that was done to be &#34;cool&#34; or experimental or hip. or perhaps it was done in hopes that it would fool people into thinking that it is somehow profound, but it does not work. nothing in this film works. it\&#39;s pretentious garbage. i can\&#39;t not recommend it enough.&#39;
b&#34;While the dog was cute, the film was not. It wasn&#39;t the premise, or the theme that was a problem. The premise had great possibilities for humor and pathos both. The theme is a worthy one. Helping other people is more important than amassing a fortune.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, the adorable dog, the unique premise, and the theme were undercut by poor acting, stilted dialogue, and amateurish filming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even my youngest child who will sit through almost anything gave up before we had gotten halfway through. How many times can that dog run up and down the same hallway? I can&#39;t spoil it for you, as I never saw the end. It just was not worth watching all the way to the end.&#34;
b&#39;When I first saw a glimpse of this movie, I quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of Lucille Ball. Rachel York\&#39;s portrayal of Lucy is absolutely awful. Lucille Ball was an astounding comedian with incredible talent. To think about a legend like Lucille Ball being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrendous. I cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York. She might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of Lucille Ball is tough. It is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent. If you noticed York\&#39;s portrayal of Lucy in episodes of I Love Lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar in any way-her expression, voice, or movement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To top it all off, Danny Pino playing Desi Arnaz is horrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He\&#39;s small and skinny, his accent is unreal, and once again, his acting is unbelievable. Although Fred and Ethel were not similar either, they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told. If people want to understand the real life situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest watching A&amp;E Biography of Lucy and Desi, read the book from Lucille Ball herself, or PBS\&#39; American Masters: Finding Lucy. If you want to see a docudrama, &#34;Before the Laughter&#34; would be a better choice. The casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in &#34;Before the Laughter&#34; is much better compared to this. At least, a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing.&#39;
b&#39;First off, the editing of this film consisted of one major flaw which I don\&#39;t understand how was missed - you consistently see the overhead microphones bobbing in and out of the film. The first time I saw it I just said &#34;well, mistakes happen&#34; and brushed it off. After about the 10th time, it began to get incredibly irritating and distractingly funny. If you haven\&#39;t seen the film yet, try counting how many times you see the microphone; might make for pretty interesting game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, about the film. This movie started out with the makings of a pretty solid &#34;ghost&#34; story; however, the plot twist at the end just ruined it completely. You begin watching the movie under the assumption, alluded by the TV commercials, that the haunted house consists of ghosts which can only be seen by children; particularly young children, which makes it even more freaky as they will be unable to effectively warn the family of the impending danger. The opening scene did a good job of misleading the audience that this would remain the premise of the film. **(SPOILER)** The movie starts with the family being stalked and ultimately killed by an &#34;unseen&#34; force in the home. The idea that only children can see these ghosts is set in motion when the daughter, at the beginning of the movie, asks her little brother to tell her where &#34;it&#34; is right before &#34;it&#34; grabs her and drags her screaming into the cellar. The young boy also witnesses this supposedly &#34;unseen force&#34; kill his mother after she tells him to hide under the bed. After his family is killed, the boy attempts to run and hide only to be snatched away as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said, this movie started out with the makings of a pretty spooky movie in which the family would be stalked by an &#34;unseen force&#34; with their only hopes of survival resting on sightings by a two-year-old. This began to be ruined less than halfway into the film as the daughter began to see the ghosts as well; completely ruining the &#34;only children can see&#34; illusion set forth by the commercials and opening scene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless of this, the movie didn\&#39;t actually get &#34;ruined&#34; until the plot twist at the end. In which the man who had been helping the family cultivate the farm turns out to have been the man responsible for killing the family at the beginning of the movie. All of a sudden, after being attacked by a swarm of crows, the man snaps and tries to kill the mother, daughter, and son while having a psychotic breakdown in which he believes them to be HIS family; which he killed at the beginning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole plot twist at the end just created a whole list of unsolved questions and left me going wtf. First, why was the family\&#39;s souls trapped in a house? If the director was going for a Ju-On (The Grudge) approach in which the family, after dying in a fit of rage, would haunt the house and kill whoever enters, why did the haunting stop after the father was &#34;captured&#34; by the ghosts of his family? If the ghosts only wanted to kill the man that killed them, why were they attacking the new family? Here\&#39;s another one for you. It takes several months from the time you sow seeds until the plants fully blossom in time for harvest. This tells me that the man who killed his family at the beginning, the man that the ghosts apparently had a grudge with the whole movie, was living on the property for months. During all this time, why didn\&#39;t the ghosts just go kill him? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie included a lot of clich\xc3\xa9d &#34;horror movie&#34; scares as well as an obvious combination of ideas from other horror movies. However, I\&#39;m telling ya, this movie still could\&#39;ve pulled off okay if not for the plot twist at the end. It\&#39;s like they just ran out of their budget and just threw together something for an ending. For this movie to have been a success, they should\&#39;ve stuck with the &#34;only children can see them&#34; premise and ended with either the family barely getting away or being killed off like the family at the beginning (would\&#39;ve opened the door for possible sequel,too).&#39;
b&#39;No offense to anyone who saw this and liked it, but I hated it! It dragged on and on and there was not a very good plot, also, too simple and the acting was so so...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give this snorefest a 2 at the most&#39;

</blockquote>
<p>So far we have been accessing our model endpoint by constructing a predictor object which uses the endpoint and then just using the predictor object to perform inference. What if we wanted to create a web app which accessed our model? The way things are set up currently makes that not possible since in order to access a SageMaker endpoint the app would first have to authenticate with AWS using an IAM role which included access to SageMaker endpoints. However, there is an easier way! We just need to use some additional AWS services.</p>
<p><img src="Web App Diagram.svg"></p>
<p>The diagram above gives an overview of how the various services will work together. On the far right is the model which we trained above and which is deployed using SageMaker. On the far left is our web app that collects a user's movie review, sends it off and expects a positive or negative sentiment in return.</p>
<p>In the middle is where some of the magic happens. We will construct a Lambda function, which you can think of as a straightforward Python function that can be executed whenever a specified event occurs. We will give this function permission to send and recieve data from a SageMaker endpoint.</p>
<p>Lastly, the method we will use to execute the Lambda function is a new endpoint that we will create using API Gateway. This endpoint will be a url that listens for data to be sent to it. Once it gets some data it will pass that data on to the Lambda function and then return whatever the Lambda function returns. Essentially it will act as an interface that lets our web app communicate with the Lambda function.</p>
<h3 id="Setting-up-a-Lambda-function">Setting up a Lambda function<a class="anchor-link" href="#Setting-up-a-Lambda-function">&#182;</a></h3><p>The first thing we are going to do is set up a Lambda function. This Lambda function will be executed whenever our public API has data sent to it. When it is executed it will receive the data, perform any sort of processing that is required, send the data (the review) to the SageMaker endpoint we've created and then return the result.</p>
<h4 id="Part-A:-Create-an-IAM-Role-for-the-Lambda-function">Part A: Create an IAM Role for the Lambda function<a class="anchor-link" href="#Part-A:-Create-an-IAM-Role-for-the-Lambda-function">&#182;</a></h4><p>Since we want the Lambda function to call a SageMaker endpoint, we need to make sure that it has permission to do so. To do this, we will construct a role that we can later give the Lambda function.</p>
<p>Using the AWS Console, navigate to the <strong>IAM</strong> page and click on <strong>Roles</strong>. Then, click on <strong>Create role</strong>. Make sure that the <strong>AWS service</strong> is the type of trusted entity selected and choose <strong>Lambda</strong> as the service that will use this role, then click <strong>Next: Permissions</strong>.</p>
<p>In the search box type <code>sagemaker</code> and select the check box next to the <strong>AmazonSageMakerFullAccess</strong> policy. Then, click on <strong>Next: Review</strong>.</p>
<p>Lastly, give this role a name. Make sure you use a name that you will remember later on, for example <code>LambdaSageMakerRole</code>. Then, click on <strong>Create role</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="Part-B:-Create-a-Lambda-function">Part B: Create a Lambda function<a class="anchor-link" href="#Part-B:-Create-a-Lambda-function">&#182;</a></h4><p>Now it is time to actually create the Lambda function.</p>
<p>Using the AWS Console, navigate to the AWS Lambda page and click on <strong>Create a function</strong>. When you get to the next page, make sure that <strong>Author from scratch</strong> is selected. Now, name your Lambda function, using a name that you will remember later on, for example <code>sentiment_analysis_func</code>. Make sure that the <strong>Python 3.6</strong> runtime is selected and then choose the role that you created in the previous part. Then, click on <strong>Create Function</strong>.</p>
<p>On the next page you will see some information about the Lambda function you've just created. If you scroll down you should see an editor in which you can write the code that will be executed when your Lambda function is triggered. In our example, we will use the code below.</p>

<p>For the integration point, make sure that <strong>Lambda Function</strong> is selected and click on the <strong>Use Lambda Proxy integration</strong>. This option makes sure that the data that is sent to the API is then sent directly to the Lambda function with no processing. It also means that the return value must be a proper response object as it will also not be processed by API Gateway.</p>
<p>Type the name of the Lambda function you created earlier into the <strong>Lambda Function</strong> text entry box and then click on <strong>Save</strong>. Click on <strong>OK</strong> in the pop-up box that then appears, giving permission to API Gateway to invoke the Lambda function you created.</p>
<p>The last step in creating the API Gateway is to select the <strong>Actions</strong> dropdown and click on <strong>Deploy API</strong>. You will need to create a new Deployment stage and name it anything you like, for example <code>prod</code>.</p>
<p>You have now successfully set up a public API to access your SageMaker model. Make sure to copy or write down the URL provided to invoke your newly created public API as this will be needed in the next step. This URL can be found at the top of the page, highlighted in blue next to the text <strong>Invoke URL</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="Step-4:-Deploying-our-web-app">Step 4: Deploying our web app<a class="anchor-link" href="#Step-4:-Deploying-our-web-app">&#182;</a></h2><p>Now that we have a publicly available API, we can start using it in a web app. For our purposes, we have provided a simple static html file which can make use of the public api you created earlier.</p>
<p>In the <code>website</code> folder there should be a file called <code>index.html</code>. Download the file to your computer and open that file up in a text editor of your choice. There should be a line which contains <strong>**REPLACE WITH PUBLIC API URL**</strong>. Replace this string with the url that you wrote down in the last step and then save the file.</p>
<p>Now, if you open <code>index.html</code> on your local computer, your browser will behave as a local web server and you can use the provided site to interact with your SageMaker model.</p>
<p>If you'd like to go further, you can host this html file anywhere you'd like, for example using github or hosting a static site on Amazon's S3. Once you have done this you can share the link with anyone you'd like and have them play with it too!</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Important Note</strong> In order for the web app to communicate with the SageMaker endpoint, the endpoint has to actually be deployed and running. This means that you are paying for it. Make sure that the endpoint is running when you want to use the web app but that you shut it down when you don't need it, otherwise you will end up with a surprisingly large AWS bill.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>TODO:</strong> Make sure that you include the edited <code>index.html</code> file in your project submission.</p>

<p>Now that your web app is working, trying playing around with it and see how well it works.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Give an example of a review that you entered into your web app. What was the predicted sentiment of your example review?</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
The review:
"This movie will make you a big fan of the genre."</p>
<p>The review was a positive one, that was correctly predicted by the model.</p>
